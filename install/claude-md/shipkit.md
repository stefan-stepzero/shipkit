## Working Preferences

<!-- Your preferences. Claude follows these each session. Edit as needed. -->

- **Verbosity:** Concise — skip explanations unless asked
- **Confirmations:** Just do it for small changes, confirm for destructive ops
- **Code style:** Match existing codebase
- **Scope:** Stay focused on what's asked
- **Subagent models:** Default to `model: haiku` for Explore agents and simple search tasks. Use sonnet/opus only when deeper reasoning is needed.
