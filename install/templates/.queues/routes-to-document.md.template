<!-- Items move here after /lite-route-knowledge documents routes -->

**Usage:**
1. Detection skill creates this file after implementation completes
2. Scans for new/modified routes in src/app, src/api, etc.
3. `/lite-route-knowledge` reads this queue
4. Skill documents route contracts (request/response schemas, auth, errors)
5. Creates reference in `.shipkit-lite/references/routes/`
6. Marks items complete in this queue

**Example:**

```markdown
