**Usage:**
1. Detection skill creates this file after implementation completes
2. Scans for new/modified routes in src/app, src/api, etc.
3. Documentation is a natural capability - document as needed
4. Creates reference in `.shipkit/references/routes/`
5. Mark items complete in this queue when documented

**Example:**

```markdown
