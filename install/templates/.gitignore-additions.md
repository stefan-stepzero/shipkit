# .gitignore Additions for Shipkit

Add these entries to your project's `.gitignore` file when using Shipkit:

```gitignore
# Shipkit - Queue files (ephemeral, auto-generated)
.shipkit/.queues/

# Shipkit - Update archives (local backups, not project state)
.shipkit-archive/

# Shipkit - Work in progress (optional, depends on your workflow)
.shipkit/specs/wip/
.shipkit/plans/wip/
```

## Why ignore .queues/?

**Queue files are ephemeral** - They're automatically created and deleted by detection skills:
- Created: When milestone hooks detect work needed (e.g., "document these components")
- Deleted: After preventative skill completes work
- Never committed: Queue state is session-specific, not project state

**Example:**
```
1. You implement a feature → detection runs
2. Creates .queues/components-to-document.md listing new components
3. You document components (natural capability)
4. Queue file deleted or archived
```

**What if I want to track queues?**
If you want to commit queue files (not recommended), remove `.queues/` from .gitignore.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✓ Ignore: Clean git history, no session noise
- ✗ Commit: Track what detection found, but clutters repo

**Recommendation:** Ignore `.queues/` - queues are workflow state, not project state.

## Why ignore .shipkit-archive/?

**Archives are local safety backups** - Created during `/shipkit-update`:
- Contains full backup of previous installation
- Lets you recover if an update causes issues
- Not project state — purely local safety net

**Each update creates a timestamped subfolder:**
```
.shipkit-archive/
├── 20240115-143000/    # First update
├── 20240220-091500/    # Second update
└── ...
```

**Recommendation:** Always ignore `.shipkit-archive/` — these are local backups, not project history.

## Why ignore specs/wip/ and plans/wip/?

**Optional WIP folders** (not yet implemented, future enhancement):
- Draft specs/plans that aren't ready for active/ folder
- Local experimentation, throw-away work
- Move to active/ when ready to implement

**Recommendation:** Ignore WIP folders if you use them, otherwise omit.
