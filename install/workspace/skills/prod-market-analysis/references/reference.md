# Market Analysis Research Guide

**This is a RESEARCH-INTENSIVE skill. You MUST use WebSearch extensively.**

## Core Principle

**Never guess. Always search.**

Market analysis based on assumptions is worthless. Every competitor mentioned, every pricing point, every feature comparison MUST come from actual research.

- Every trend needs a citation

**When in doubt: Search. Then search again. Then cite your sources.**
