## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The "Everything Company"
**Mistake:**
- Values: "Innovation, Quality, Customer Focus, Integrity, Teamwork"
- Could describe literally any company

**Fix:**
- Be specific: "We ship half-baked features and iterate based on usage, not perfection"

### The Personality Crisis
**Mistake:**
- Copy: "Yo! Check out our sick new features! 🔥"
- Visuals: Corporate blue, formal serif fonts

**Fix:**
- Match voice and visuals. If playful, be playful everywhere.

### The Thesaurus Attack
**Mistake:**
- "Leverage our innovative paradigm-shifting solution to synergize your workflow"

**Fix:**
- "Get your work done faster"

### The Generic Tech Startup
**Mistake:**
- Blue/purple gradient
- Sans-serif font
- "We're making [industry] simple"

**Fix:**
- Find ONE thing that's actually different and emphasize it

## Testing Your Brand

### The Swap Test
Could you swap your brand guidelines with a competitor and no one would notice?
→ If yes, be more specific.

### The Cringe Test
Read your voice/tone examples out loud.
→ If it sounds like a corporate robot, rewrite.

### The Screenshot Test
Take screenshots of competitors' products.
→ Could your brand apply to their UI? If yes, differentiate more.

### The Grandma Test
Can you explain your brand personality to a non-technical person in one sentence?
→ If no, it's too abstract.
