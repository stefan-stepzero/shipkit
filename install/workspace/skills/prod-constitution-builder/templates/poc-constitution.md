# POC Product Constitution

**Context:** Proof of Concept - Validating if idea has legs
**Generated:** [Date]

---

## Prime Directive
Answer ONE question: "Will people use this?"

---

## FORBIDDEN

- ❌ **Production-ready code** (it's throwaway, embrace it)
- ❌ **User accounts** (use hardcoded test users)
- ❌ **Databases** (JSON files are fine)
- ❌ **Responsive design** (pick one: desktop OR mobile)
- ❌ **Error handling** (happy path only)
- ❌ **Security** (don't collect real data yet)
- ❌ **Deployment** (run on localhost, screen share with users)
- ❌ **Testing** (any kind)
- ❌ **Documentation** (code comments MAX)
- ❌ **More than one feature** (ONE job to be done)

---

## REQUIRED

- ✅ **ONE core feature works** (user can do the ONE thing)
- ✅ **5 people tried it** (minimum validation sample)
- ✅ **Ask: Would you pay $X for this?** (gauge willingness to pay)
- ✅ **Write down what you learned** (notion doc, markdown file, whatever)
- ✅ **Decide: Build MVP or kill idea?** (within 2 weeks MAX)

---

## ALLOWED (Everything)

**This is throwaway code. Optimize for SPEED:**

- Hardcode everything
- Copy-paste code
- Use ChatGPT/Claude for entire features
- Mix languages/frameworks (doesn't matter)
- No git (seriously, it's fine)
- No code review
- No architecture
- Inline styles
- Global variables
- Any shortcut that ships faster

**The ONLY thing that matters:** Can you show this to 5 people and get useful feedback?

---

## Decision Framework

**One question:** Does this help me validate the idea faster?

- YES → Do it
- NO → Don't do it

**That's it.**

---

## Success Criteria

**POC is successful when you can answer:**

1. **Do people have this problem?** (YES/NO)
2. **Does this solution resonate?** (YES/NO)
3. **Would they pay for it?** (YES/NO)
4. **Am I excited to build this?** (YES/NO)

**If 4/4 YES → Build MVP (adopt MVP constitution)**
**If 3/4 YES → Pivot and retest**
**If < 3 YES → Kill idea, try new one**

---

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks MAX
**Next Step:** If validated → Throw away POC code, build MVP properly
