# Stakeholder Communication Best Practices

## The Art of Stakeholder Communication

Every audience has different needs, contexts, and questions. Effective communication adapts to the audience while staying grounded in truth.

**Core Principle:** One source of truth (your product research), many formats (tailored to each audience).

## Know Your Audience

### Investors

**What they care about:**
- Growth potential (market size, TAM)
- Traction (revenue, customers, engagement)
- Competitive moat (defensibility)
- Team strength (can you execute?)
- Return on investment (exit potential)

**What they DON'T care about:**
- Feature details
- Technical architecture
- Day-to-day operations

**Tone:** Confident, data-driven, strategic
**Length:** Concise (1-2 pages max for one-pagers, 10-15 slides for decks)
**Format:** Visual (charts, metrics, growth curves)

---

### Executives / Board

**What they care about:**
- Strategic alignment (does this fit our vision?)
- Resource allocation (is this the best use of budget/people?)
- Risk management (what could go wrong?)
- Competitive position (are we winning?)
- Business outcomes (revenue, margin, market share)

**What they DON'T care about:**
- Implementation details
- Individual feature specs
- Team drama or process

**Tone:** Strategic, analytical, decision-focused
**Length:** Executive summary (1 page) + supporting detail (5-10 pages)
**Format:** Structured (clear sections, tables, bullet points)

**Decision Framework:**
- Always include: Recommendation, Options, Risks
- Back claims with data
- Be clear about what you need (approval, input, resources)

---

### Product Team / Engineering

**What they care about:**
- Why we're building this (customer problem)
- What success looks like (metrics, goals)
- How we'll work (process, roles, timeline)
- Scope and constraints (what's in/out)
- Their role and impact (how they contribute)

**What they DON'T care about:**
- Business financials (unless it affects resources)
- Investor relations
- High-level strategy (unless it affects their work)

**Tone:** Collaborative, clear, motivating
**Length:** Comprehensive (enough detail to understand and execute)
**Format:** Narrative with visuals (timelines, feature lists, diagrams)

**Motivation:**
- Connect work to customer impact
- Show how it fits the bigger picture
- Acknowledge challenges and risks honestly

---

### Customers

**What they care about:**
- How this helps them (solves their problem)
- How to use it (simple, clear steps)
- What it costs (pricing, plans)
- Social proof (does it work for others like me?)
- What comes next (roadmap, future value)

**What they DON'T care about:**
- Your internal process
- Technical implementation
- Company strategy

**Tone:** Friendly, benefit-focused, helpful
**Length:** Scannable (headlines, bullets, visuals)
**Format:** Story-driven (problem → solution → success)

**Customer Communication Principles:**
1. Lead with the benefit, not the feature
2. Show, don't just tell (demos, screenshots, examples)
3. Make it easy to get started (clear CTA, low friction)
4. Provide social proof (testimonials, case studies)
5. Answer "what's in it for me?" in the first paragraph

## Communication Types & When to Use Them

### Investor One-Pager

**When to use:**
- First outreach to potential investors
- Warm intro through VC connection
- Demo day or pitch competition
- Fundraising kick-off

**Goal:** Get a meeting

**Key elements:**
- Problem (one sentence)
- Solution (one sentence)
- Traction (metrics that prove momentum)
- Team (why you'll win)
- Ask (how much, what for)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Too much text (investors skim, not read)
- Vague metrics ("growing fast" vs "40% MoM")
- No clear ask
- Missing contact info

---

### Executive Summary

**When to use:**
- Strategic initiative approval
- Quarterly business reviews
- Board updates (pre-read before meeting)
- Cross-functional alignment

**Goal:** Enable informed decision-making

**Key elements:**
- TL;DR (busy execs read this first)
- Business case (why this matters)
- Recommendation (what you want)
- Risks and mitigations (show you've thought it through)
- Financial impact (revenue, cost, ROI)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Burying the lede (put recommendation up front)
- No clear ask or decision needed
- Overoptimism (acknowledge risks)
- Missing financial impact

---

### Team Update

**When to use:**
- Kicking off new project/sprint
- Mid-project alignment check
- Communicating scope or priority changes
- Celebrating milestones

**Goal:** Align team, motivate execution

**Key elements:**
- Why (customer problem, strategic context)
- What (features, scope, deliverables)
- How (timeline, roles, process)
- Success (how we'll measure)
- Guardrails (constraints, principles)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Top-down dictation (invite collaboration)
- Vague scope (be specific about in/out of scope)
- Ignoring risks (team knows they exist)
- No connection to customer impact

---

### Customer Announcement

**When to use:**
- Product launch
- Major feature release
- New pricing/plans
- Company milestone

**Goal:** Drive adoption, excitement, trust

**Key elements:**
- Headline (benefit-focused)
- Problem/solution (why this matters to them)
- How it works (simple, clear)
- Social proof (testimonials, early results)
- Call-to-action (what to do next)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Feature list without benefits
- Company-centric language ("we're excited to announce" vs "you can now...")
- Jargon or technical terminology
- Weak or missing CTA

---

### Board Deck

**When to use:**
- Quarterly board meetings
- Strategic planning sessions
- Fundraising board approval
- Major decision points

**Goal:** Update board, get input, make decisions

**Key elements:**
- Executive summary (slide 2)
- Metrics dashboard (always include)
- Progress on priorities (from last meeting)
- Risks and asks (be explicit)
- Strategic decisions (clearly framed options)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Reading slides verbatim (deck should support, not replace presentation)
- Hiding bad news (board is there to help)
- No clear asks (what do you need from the board?)
- Overloaded slides (too much text/data)

---

## Crafting Compelling Messages

### The Pyramid Principle

Start with the conclusion, then support it.

**Structure:**
1. **Top:** Main message (answer/recommendation)
2. **Middle:** Key supporting arguments (3-5 points)
3. **Bottom:** Detailed evidence (data, examples)

**Example:**
- **Top:** "We should launch the mobile app in Q2"
- **Middle:**
  - 60% of users access us via mobile web (demand exists)
  - Competitors launched mobile apps and saw 2x engagement (market validation)
  - We have budget and team capacity (feasibility)
- **Bottom:**
  - User survey data (300 respondents)
  - Competitor analysis (App Annie data)
  - Engineering capacity plan (detailed in appendix)

**Why this works:** Busy stakeholders can read the top and decide if they need more detail.

---

### The Narrative Arc

For longer communications (team updates, customer announcements), use storytelling.

**Structure:**
1. **Setup:** Current state (what's happening today)
2. **Problem:** The pain or opportunity
3. **Journey:** Our path to solving it
4. **Resolution:** What we're launching/doing
5. **Future:** What comes next

**Example (Customer Launch):**
1. **Setup:** "You've been managing customer support via email and spreadsheets"
2. **Problem:** "It's chaotic—tickets get lost, response times are slow, customers are frustrated"
3. **Journey:** "We spent 6 months talking to support teams like yours"
4. **Resolution:** "Today we're launching Support Hub—one place to track, prioritize, and resolve tickets"
5. **Future:** "Coming soon: automation, reporting, and integrations with Slack"

---

### Data Storytelling

Numbers alone don't persuade. Frame them.

**Bad:** "We have 10,000 users"
**Good:** "We've grown from 0 to 10,000 users in 6 months—doubling every 8 weeks"

**Bad:** "87% of users return within 7 days"
**Good:** "Our retention is stronger than Slack at the same stage (87% vs 75%)"

**Bad:** "CAC is $150"
**Good:** "We acquire customers for $150 and they're worth $900 LTV—a 6:1 return"

**Techniques:**
- **Comparisons:** Benchmark against competitors, industry standards, your own history
- **Trends:** Show direction, not just point-in-time
- **Context:** Explain why the number matters

## Writing Tips by Audience

### For Investors

**Do:**
- Lead with traction metrics
- Use visuals (charts, growth curves)
- Show momentum (MoM growth, milestones)
- Name-drop impressive customers/partners
- Quantify market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

**Don't:**
- Use jargon or technical terms
- Overexplain features
- Be vague about fundraising ask
- Ignore competition

**Killer phrases:**
- "Growing X% month-over-month"
- "Crossed $XM ARR"
- "Signed [impressive customer]"
- "Doubling every X months"

---

### For Executives

**Do:**
- Start with recommendation
- Present options (not just one path)
- Quantify impact (revenue, cost, risk)
- Acknowledge trade-offs
- Be concise (execs are time-constrained)

**Don't:**
- Bury the ask
- Overpromise or sugarcoat
- Present problems without solutions
- Use passive voice

**Killer phrases:**
- "I recommend [X] because [reason]"
- "This will generate $X in revenue by [date]"
- "The key trade-off is [X vs Y]"
- "We need [decision/resource] by [date] to stay on track"

---

### For Product Team

**Do:**
- Explain the "why" (customer problem)
- Be specific about scope
- Show the timeline and milestones
- Clarify roles and ownership
- Invite feedback and questions

**Don't:**
- Be top-down or dictatorial

**Killer phrases:**
- "Here's what we learned from customers..."
- "In scope: [X]. Out of scope: [Y]"
- "Success looks like [measurable outcome]"
- "What questions or concerns do you have?"

---

### For Customers

**Do:**
- Lead with benefits (not features)
- Use plain language (no jargon)
- Show social proof (testimonials)
- Make it scannable (headlines, bullets)
- Include clear CTA

**Don't:**
- Use internal terminology
- Make it about you ("We're excited to..." → "You can now...")
- Overwhelm with options
- Forget the CTA

**Killer phrases:**
- "Save X hours per week"
- "See results in X days"
- "[Customer name] increased [metric] by X%"
- "Get started in 3 steps"

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Wrong Level of Detail

**Problem:** Investors don't care about technical architecture. Engineers don't care about TAM.

**Fix:** Adjust detail to audience. Use appendices for deep dives.

### Mistake 2: No Clear Ask

**Problem:** Stakeholder reads your update and thinks "okay, so what?"

**Fix:** Always end with: "Here's what I need from you..."

### Mistake 3: Hiding Bad News

**Problem:** Sugarcoating problems erodes trust and delays fixes.

**Fix:** Be honest about challenges, but pair with mitigations.

**Example:**
- Bad: "Everything is on track!" (when it's not)
- Good: "We're 2 weeks behind due to [X]. Here's how we're recovering..."

### Mistake 4: Feature Lists Without Benefits

**Problem:** "We built X, Y, and Z" doesn't tell stakeholders why they should care.

**Fix:** Connect features to outcomes. "We built X so customers can [benefit]"

### Mistake 5: Too Long

**Problem:** Stakeholders don't have time to read 20 pages.

**Fix:**
- Investors: 1-2 pages max
- Execs: 1-page summary + appendix
- Team: As long as needed, but scannable
- Customers: 2-3 minute read

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't say it in one page, you don't understand it well enough.

## Templates as Starting Points

The templates in this skill are starting points—adapt them to your context.

**Customize for:**
- Your industry (B2B vs B2C language)
- Your stage (seed vs series B vs public)
- Your audience (technical vs non-technical)
- Your culture (formal vs casual tone)

**When in doubt:**
- Shorter is better
- Benefits over features
- Data over opinions
- Clarity over cleverness

---

**Remember:** Great communication isn't about sounding smart—it's about making your stakeholders smarter about your product and confident in your vision.
