### The Job Journey

**1. Triggering Event**
- External: Sunday evening arrives, week is starting tomorrow
- Internal: Glance at empty week ahead, realize "I need to figure out dinners"
- Urgency: Medium (could wing it, but that's stressful)

**2. Problem Awareness**
Recalls the chaos of last week when they didn't plan ahead—Tuesday night scramble, ordering pizza on Thursday, wasting food that went bad.

**3. Solution Exploration**
- Opens Pinterest for recipe inspiration (too overwhelming)
- Checks favorite food blogs (takes forever)
- Texts spouse "any requests for dinner this week?" (unhelpful "whatever you want")
- Looks through previous meal plans (can't remember what we ate)

**4. Decision Making**
- Key factors: Quick to plan, easy to cook, family will eat it
- Deal-breakers: Complicated recipes, exotic ingredients, long cook times on weeknights
- No approval needed, but spouse veto power on meals they hate

**5. Implementation/Execution**
- Jots down meal ideas in Notes app

- Manually writes shopping list
- Shops on Monday evening, cooks throughout week

**6. Evaluation**
- Success = Made it through the week without ordering takeout or scrambling
- Failure = Had to abandon plan mid-week, wasted food
- Reviews informally (mental note of what worked)

### Current Solutions

**Solution 1: Pinterest + Notes App**
- Strengths:
  - Lots of recipe inspiration
  - Free
  - Notes app is familiar
- Weaknesses:
  - Overwhelming (too many choices)
  - No integration (separate recipe, pantry list, shopping list)
  - No memory (can't remember what was cooked last week)
- Workarounds:
  - Screenshots recipes to save them
  - Manual shopping list consolidation
  - Spouse's memory for "didn't we just have that?"

**Solution 2: Pre-Made Meal Kit Subscriptions**
- Strengths:
  - Zero planning required
  - Recipes are good
  - Portion-controlled
- Weaknesses:
  - Expensive ($60-80/week for 3 meals)
  - Inflexible (can't use pantry staples)
  - Still need to plan other 2-3 nights
- Discontinued after 2 months (too costly)

**DIY / Manual Approach:**
- Open fridge/pantry, brainstorm what could be made
- Write down 5-6 meals on sticky note
- Shop for missing ingredients
- Time required: 45-60 minutes (planning) + 15 minutes (shopping list)
- Failure modes: Forget what's in pantry, buy duplicates; Choose meals that don't match schedule

**Do Nothing / Status Quo:**
- Cost of inaction: Stressful weeknights, unhealthy convenience food, wasted money
- Why tolerate: Planning is boring, current approach is "good enough most weeks"
- Tipping point: Week of chaos (multiple takeout nights, family complains)

### Pain Points & Obstacles

**Before Starting:**
1. Decision fatigue from too many recipe options
   - Impact: Takes 30+ minutes just browsing recipes
   - Severity: High

- Acceptable: 30 minutes
- Current: 45-60 minutes

**Desired Output Quality:**
- Good enough (not Instagram-worthy)
- Balanced nutrition (but not obsessive)

## Example 2: B2B SaaS - Customer Support Manager

### Core Job Statement

> **When** my support team's ticket volume spikes unexpectedly,
> **I want to** quickly understand the root cause and respond appropriately,
> **So I can** prevent SLA breaches and maintain customer satisfaction.

### Job Context

**Situation:**
Support manager at B2B SaaS company (50-person team, 2000 customers). Monday morning, ticket queue is 40% higher than normal. CEO is asking what's going on.

**Frequency:**
- How often: Weekly (volume spikes 1-2x/week)
- Duration: Currently takes 45-90 minutes to diagnose
- Time constraints: Must respond to exec team within 2 hours

**Environment:**
- Where: Office or remote, monitoring Slack + support dashboard
- With whom: Support team (scattered, handling tickets), engineering team (may need to escalate)
- Concurrent activities: Ongoing triage, team questions, exec pings

### Functional Dimensions

**What They're Trying to Accomplish:**
1. Identify root cause of ticket spike (product bug, outage, customer confusion, etc.)
2. Assess severity and customer impact
3. Coordinate response (comms, escalation, workarounds)

**Inputs Required:**
- Ticket data (volume, categories, keywords)
- Product health metrics (uptime, errors, deployments)
- Customer context (which customers are affected, are they high-value?)
- Historical patterns (is this normal Monday volume or truly abnormal?)

**Outputs/Deliverables:**
- Root cause hypothesis
- Action plan (escalate to eng, send customer comms, document workaround)
- Executive summary for leadership

**Success Criteria (Functional):**
- [ ] Root cause identified within 30 minutes
- [ ] No SLA breaches (tickets resolved within committed timeframes)
- [ ] Customer-facing communication sent (if needed)

### Emotional Dimensions

**How They Want to Feel:**
- In control (not blindsided)
- Confident (when explaining to execs)
- Calm (not panicked despite spike)
- Proactive (ahead of problems, not reactive)

**Current Emotional State:**
- **Before starting:** Anxiety (is this a major incident?), dread (exec team will ask questions)
- **During the job:** Stress (clock is ticking), frustration (too many tools to check)
- **After completion:** Relief (if resolved quickly), lingering worry (did I miss something?)

**Emotional Barriers:**
- Fear of escalating unnecessarily (looking alarmist)
- Fear of NOT escalating when should (looking incompetent)
- Anxiety about being blamed for problems outside their control

**Success Criteria (Emotional):**
- [ ] "I feel confident explaining this to leadership"
- [ ] "I feel like I responded quickly and appropriately"
- [ ] "I don't feel like I'm constantly in firefighting mode"

### Social Dimensions

**Who Cares About This Job:**
- CEO / Leadership: Expect proactive incident management, customer satisfaction
- Engineering Team: Don't want to be interrupted unless necessary
- Support Team: Look to manager for direction and clarity
- Customers: Expect timely resolution and communication

**Social Motivations:**
- Demonstrate competence to leadership (potential promotion consideration)
- Maintain trust of support team (they rely on me for decisions)
- Protect company reputation (avoid public customer complaints)

**Social Barriers:**
- Risk of looking incompetent if root cause analysis is wrong
- Risk of annoying engineering with false alarms
- Organizational politics (if spike is due to bad product decision)

**Success Criteria (Social):**
- [ ] "Leadership sees me as reliable and proactive"
- [ ] "My team feels supported and clear on priorities"
- [ ] "Engineering respects my judgment on escalations"

### The Job Journey

**1. Triggering Event**
- External: Monitoring dashboard shows queue depth spike, Slack message from team lead "ticket volume seems high today"
- Urgency: High (SLA clock is ticking, customers are waiting)

**2. Problem Awareness**
Realizes this isn't normal Monday volume. Needs to figure out why before CEO asks (which will happen).

**3. Solution Exploration**
- Checks support platform (Zendesk): Can see volume is high, but not why
- Checks product monitoring (Datadog): No obvious outage
- Asks team in Slack: "Anyone seeing a pattern in the tickets?"
- Manually reads recent tickets to spot keywords/themes

**4. Decision Making**
- If clear pattern → Document and respond
- If ambiguous → Spend more time investigating before escalating
- Key criteria: Customer impact severity, is it growing?

**5. Implementation**
- If product bug → Escalate to engineering, document workaround
- If customer confusion → Send clarifying email to affected customers, update docs
- If normal variance → Reassure team, keep monitoring

**6. Evaluation**
- Did tickets plateau/decrease after response?
- Did customers respond positively to comms?
- Did executives feel informed?

### Current Solutions

**Solution 1: Zendesk + Datadog + Manual Triage**
- How they use it:
  - Check Zendesk for ticket volume/categories
  - Check Datadog for product errors
  - Read tickets manually to spot themes
  - Ask team for qualitative input
- Strengths:
  - Zendesk shows volume trends
  - Datadog catches obvious outages
  - Team has context on individual customers
- Weaknesses:
  - No automatic pattern detection
  - Slow (have to check 3-4 places, read tickets manually)
  - Reactive (dashboard shows problem exists, not why)
- Workarounds:
  - Built custom Zendesk tags for common issues (but team forgets to use them)
  - Manually export ticket data to Excel for analysis (too slow)
  - Created Slack channel for "anyone seeing X issue?" (inconsistent)

**Solution 2: Weekly Review Meetings**
- Strengths: Team can discuss patterns
- Weaknesses: Happens AFTER the spike, not during
- Not a solution for real-time diagnosis

**DIY Approach:**
- Manually read last 20 tickets, look for themes
- Check product deployment log (did we ship something recently?)
- Time required: 30-60 minutes
- Failure modes: Miss subtle patterns, slow to respond, confirmation bias (see what you expect)

**Do Nothing:**
- Cost of inaction: SLA breaches, angry customers, exec scrutiny, team stress
- Why tolerate: Current approach works "eventually"
- Tipping point: Major customer churn incident blamed on slow response

### Pain Points & Obstacles

**Before Starting:**
1. Don't have real-time visibility into ticket themes
   - Impact: Have to manually investigate every time
   - Severity: Critical

2. Data is scattered across tools (Zendesk, Datadog, Slack, Google Sheets)
   - Impact: Slow to get full picture
   - Severity: High

**During the Job:**
1. Can't quickly determine if spike is isolated or widespread
   - Impact: Risk over-reacting or under-reacting
   - Severity: Critical

2. Team is asking for direction while I'm still diagnosing
   - Impact: Divided attention, delayed response
   - Severity: High

**After Completing:**
1. No easy way to remember "we saw this pattern before"
   - Impact: Re-diagnosing same issues repeatedly
   - Severity: Medium

### Desired Outcomes

**Desired Speed:**
- Ideal: Root cause identified in under 10 minutes
- Acceptable: 30 minutes
- Current: 45-90 minutes

**Desired Output Quality:**
- High confidence in root cause (not guessing)
- Clear action plan
- Exec-ready summary

**Desired Cost:**
- Budget: Up to $500/month for a tool that solves this
- ROI: Prevent even one customer churn ($50k/year contract) and it pays for itself

**Desired Effort:**
- Minimal setup (IT is swamped, can't wait months for implementation)
- Low learning curve (team needs to adopt it quickly)
- Automated (not more manual work)

**Desired Control:**
- Customizable alerts (different thresholds for different issue types)
- Visibility into historical patterns
- Ability to drill down into specific customer segments

### Forces Acting on This Job

**Forces PUSHING Toward Change:**

- "Do I have budget?" (needs VP approval for >$10k/year)

**Forces MAINTAINING Status Quo (Habit):**
- Current approach is familiar
- Team is used to the manual workflow
- Buying new software requires vendor evaluation, security review, procurement (3-month process)
- "It's not broken enough to prioritize fixing"

### Our Solution's Job Fit

**How We Help Them Get the Job Done:**
Auto-detect ticket spike patterns in real-time. When volume increases, automatically categorize by theme (product bug, customer confusion, feature request, etc.) and surface root cause hypothesis with supporting evidence (sample tickets, affected customers, correlation with deployments).

**Unique Job Advantage:**
Other tools show THAT there's a spike. We show WHY there's a spike—in under 5 minutes, with evidence.

**Job-Solution Alignment:**
- Functional: 10-minute root cause analysis (vs 60 minutes)
- Emotional: Confidence (data-backed hypothesis vs guessing)
- Social: Exec-ready summary (look proactive to leadership)

**Reducing Forces Against:**
- Anxiety: 14-day free trial, Zendesk native integration (no IT required), AI explains its reasoning
- Habit: Auto-starts analyzing (no behavior change needed), surfaces insights in Slack (where they already are)

### Success Metrics for This Job

**Adoption Indicators:**
- [ ] Manager accesses tool within 5 minutes of a ticket spike
- [ ] Manager shares root cause hypothesis with team within 15 minutes

**Outcome Indicators:**
- [ ] Time to root cause reduced from 60 min → 15 min
