# lite-communications - Visual HTML Reports

**Purpose**: Create beautiful, visual HTML reports from any ShipKit Lite content for presentations, sharing, or visual review.

**What it does**: Reads markdown content from `.shipkit-lite/`, generates styled HTML with purple gradient theme, archives old reports, creates `latest.html`.

---

## When to Invoke

**User triggers**:
- "Visualize the architecture decisions"
- "Create HTML report"
- "Make a visual status report"
- "Generate presentation from project status"
- "Show me quality checklist as HTML"
- "Create shareable report"

**Use cases**:
- Share architecture decisions with team
- Present project status to stakeholders
- Visual review of quality checklist
- Export component documentation as HTML
- Create visual specs for review

---

## Prerequisites

**Optional** (depends on what user wants to visualize):
- `.shipkit-lite/architecture.md` - For architecture decisions
- `.shipkit-lite/implementations.md` - For component/route docs
- `.shipkit-lite/stack.md` - For tech stack overview
- `.shipkit-lite/specs/active/*.md` - For specs
- `.shipkit-lite/plans/*.md` - For implementation plans

**No strict prerequisites** - Can create HTML from any content.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Ask What to Visualize

**Before generating anything**, ask user what they want to visualize:

**Present options:**
```
What would you like to visualize as HTML?

1. Architecture Decisions - Visual timeline of decisions
2. Project Status - Complete health dashboard
3. Quality Checklist - Pre-ship verification
4. Component Documentation - All components/routes
5. Feature Specs - Active specifications
6. Implementation Plans - Current plans
7. Tech Stack - Visual stack overview
8. Custom - You specify the files

Choose a number or describe what you need:
```

**Wait for user response.**

---

### Step 2: Determine Source Files

**Based on user choice, identify which .shipkit-lite/ files to read:**

| Choice | Files to Read | Description Word |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| 1. Architecture Decisions | `.shipkit-lite/architecture.md` | `architecture-decisions` |
| 2. Project Status | Glob `.shipkit-lite/**/*.md` | `project-status` |
| 3. Quality Checklist | `.shipkit-lite/implementations.md`, `.shipkit-lite/specs/active/*.md` | `quality-checklist` |
| 4. Component Documentation | `.shipkit-lite/implementations.md` | `component-docs` |
| 5. Feature Specs | `.shipkit-lite/specs/active/*.md` | `feature-specs` |
| 6. Implementation Plans | `.shipkit-lite/plans/*.md` | `implementation-plans` |
| 7. Tech Stack | `.shipkit-lite/stack.md` | `tech-stack` |
| 8. Custom | User-specified files | User-specified description |

**Description word**: Used for archive filename (2-4 kebab-case words)

---

### Step 3: Read Source Content

**Use Read tool to load source markdown files.**

**Examples:**

For architecture decisions:
```
Read: .shipkit-lite/architecture.md
```

For project status (comprehensive):
```
Glob: .shipkit-lite/**/*.md
Read each file found
```

For quality checklist:
```
Read: .shipkit-lite/implementations.md
Glob: .shipkit-lite/specs/active/*.md
```

**IMPORTANT**: Actually read files - don't generate placeholder content.

---

### Step 4: Check for Existing latest.html

**Check if `.shipkit-lite/communications/latest.html` already exists:**

```
If latest.html exists:
  1. Get current timestamp: YYYYMMDD-HHMM format
  2. Create archive filename: YYYYMMDD-HHMM-{description}.html
     Example: 20251228-1430-architecture-decisions.html
  3. Use Read tool to read latest.html content
  4. Use Write tool to create archive:
     Path: .shipkit-lite/communications/archive/{timestamp}-{description}.html
     Content: [contents of old latest.html]
  5. Proceed to generate new latest.html

If latest.html does NOT exist:
  1. Proceed directly to generate new latest.html
```

**Archive naming examples:**
- `20251228-1430-architecture-decisions.html`
- `20251228-1515-project-status.html`
- `20251228-1620-quality-checklist.html`

---

### Step 5: Generate HTML

**Create beautiful, styled HTML using the template structure.**

**Complete HTML template**: See `references/html-template.md`

**Key template features**:
- Purple gradient theme (`#667eea` → `#764ba2`)
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Mermaid.js support via CDN
- Inline CSS (no external dependencies)
- Clean typography and spacing

**Template variables to replace**:
- `{Report Title}` - Main title
- `{Report Subtitle}` - Subtitle
- `{Current DateTime}` - Full timestamp
- `{Current Date}` - Date only
- `{CONVERTED MARKDOWN CONTENT HERE}` - HTML-converted content

**Content Conversion Rules:**

1. **Markdown to HTML**: Convert markdown content to semantic HTML
   - `# Header` → `<h2>`
   - `## Header` → `<h3>`
   - `### Header` → `<h4>`
   - `**bold**` → `<strong>`
   - `*italic*` → `<em>`
   - Lists → `<ul>` / `<ol>`
   - Code blocks → `<pre><code>`
   - Inline code → `<code>`
   - Tables → `<table>`

2. **Special Sections**: Wrap important sections in cards
   - Decisions → `.card` div
   - Warnings → `.card` with warning style
   - Key points → `.card`

3. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Detect markdown code blocks with `mermaid` language:
   ````markdown
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   A --> B
   ```
   ````
   Convert to:
   ```html
   <div class="mermaid">
   graph TD
   A --> B
   </div>
   ```

4. **Timestamps**: Use current datetime in header

**Report Title Examples:**
- "Architecture Decisions"
- "Project Status Dashboard"
- "Quality Confidence Report"
- "Component Documentation"

---

### Step 6: Write latest.html

**Use Write tool to create:**

**Location**: `.shipkit-lite/communications/latest.html`

**Content**: Complete HTML generated in Step 5

**Example Write call:**
```
Write tool:
  File: .shipkit-lite/communications/latest.html
  Content: [Full HTML from Step 5]
```

---

### Step 7: Confirm to User

**After creating HTML, tell user:**

```
✅ Visual HTML report created

📁 Location: .shipkit-lite/communications/latest.html

📊 Report type: {Description}

{IF ARCHIVED}
🗄️  Previous report archived:
   .shipkit-lite/communications/archive/{timestamp}-{description}.html
{END IF}

👉 Open latest.html in your browser to view the report.
```

---

## Workspace Structure

**This skill creates:**

```
.shipkit-lite/
  communications/
    latest.html                                    # Always current report
    archive/
      20251228-1430-architecture-decisions.html   # Previous reports
      20251228-1515-project-status.html
      20251228-1620-quality-checklist.html
```

**Always one `latest.html`** - Easy to find current report

**Archive preserves history** - Never lose previous visualizations
