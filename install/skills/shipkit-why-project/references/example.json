  "vision": "A streamlined product development framework that helps solo developers and small teams ship quality products faster by providing structured workflows built on Claude Code.",
  "problem": "Claude Code is powerful but developers start each session fresh, losing context and making inconsistent decisions. There's no structured way to maintain project continuity across sessions.",
  "targetUsers": "Solo developers and small teams (1-5 people) building web applications who want to move fast without sacrificing quality. They use Claude Code but need better session-to-session continuity.",
  "currentState": "MVP - Core skills implemented, basic workflow operational. Used internally for product development.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "Developers can resume work seamlessly across sessions without re-explaining context",
    "Key decisions (architecture, UX, specs) are captured and auto-loaded",
    "5-minute setup gets a new project to productive state",
    "Positive feedback from 10+ external users"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must work within Claude Code's native skill system - no parallel systems",
    "Keep context files small (<500 tokens each) to minimize session overhead",
    "Zero external dependencies beyond Claude Code",
    "Must be installable via single command"
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Not a replacement for full project management tools",
    "Not targeting enterprise teams with complex approval workflows",
    "Not building custom UI/dashboard - terminal-first approach",
    "Not supporting non-Claude AI assistants"
  ],
  "timeline": {
    "target": "Q2 2025 public release",

    ]
  },
  "approach": "Build incrementally on Claude Code primitives. Each skill captures one type of decision. Auto-load critical context at session start. Prioritize developer experience over feature count."
