## After Completion

**Guardrails Check:** Before moving to next task, verify:

1. **Persistence** - Has important context been saved to `.shipkit-lite/`?
2. **Prerequisites** - Does the next action need a spec or plan first?
3. **Session length** - Long session? Consider `/lite-work-memory` for continuity.

**Natural capabilities** (no skill needed): Implementation, debugging, testing, refactoring, code documentation.

**Suggest skill when:** User needs to make decisions, create persistence, or check project status.
