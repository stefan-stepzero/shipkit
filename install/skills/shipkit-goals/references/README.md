# shipkit-goals References

## Purpose
Extended documentation, derivation patterns, and examples for shipkit-goals (v2 — success criteria & stage gates).

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `output-schema.md` | Full JSON schema for `.shipkit/goals.json` v2 — criteria, gates, and all field definitions |
| `derivation-patterns.md` | How to derive criteria from product-definition.json: mechanism → performance/quality/reliability, pattern → usability/completion/responsiveness, differentiator → validation, MVP boundary → completeness |
| `example.json` | Realistic WorksheetForge example with 12 criteria across 2 stage gates |

## When to Use
- `output-schema.md` — When you need the exact field definitions and types for goals.json
- `derivation-patterns.md` — When proposing criteria: use the patterns to transform each definition section into measurable criteria with thresholds
- `example.json` — When you need a concrete reference for how the v2 format looks with real data
