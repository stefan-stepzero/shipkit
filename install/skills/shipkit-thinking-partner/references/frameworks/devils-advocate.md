# Devil's Advocate Framework

## When to Use
- When the user has a strong preference and needs stress-testing
- When "I'm leaning toward X" needs rigorous challenge
- When groupthink or confirmation bias may be present
- After a decision is tentatively made but before commitment

## Conversational Application

### Step 1: Understand the Position
Ask: "Walk me through why you're leaning toward this option."

Listen for:
- Strength of conviction (is this a tentative lean or strong preference?)
- Quality of reasoning (evidence-based or gut feel?)
- Awareness of downsides (already considered, or blind?)

### Step 2: Steelman the Opposite
Before attacking the preferred option, build the strongest case FOR the alternative:
- "Let me make the best possible case for the other option..."
- Present genuine advantages, not strawmen
- Use real-world examples or analogies

### Step 3: Challenge Core Assumptions
Pick the 2-3 strongest reasons for the preferred option and challenge each:
- "You said X is faster to implement — but what about the learning curve? The long-term maintenance?"
- "You said Y has better community support — but is that support for your specific use case?"
- "You said Z is more scalable — but do you actually need that scale?"

### Step 4: Explore Worst Case
Ask: "If you choose this and it's wrong, what's the worst that happens?"
- How expensive is it to reverse?
- What's the recovery time?
- What's lost that can't be recovered?

### Step 5: Flip the Burden of Proof
Ask: "Instead of proving this is right, can you prove the alternative is wrong?"

This forces examination of assumptions from the other direction. Often, people realize they can't actually disprove alternatives — they just prefer their choice.

### Step 6: Final Test
Ask: "Having heard all this, has your conviction changed? Strengthened? Weakened?"

Three outcomes:
- **Conviction strengthened** — Good. The decision survived stress-testing.
- **Conviction weakened** — Good. More analysis needed before committing.
- **Switched preference** — Good. Better to discover this now than after implementation.

## Tone Guidelines
- Challenge firmly but respectfully
- Never mock or dismiss the preferred option
- Acknowledge when the user's reasoning is strong
- Make it clear you're playing a role, not expressing a personal opinion
