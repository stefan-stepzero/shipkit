# Option Evaluation Rubric

## When to Use
- Comparing 3+ options across multiple dimensions
- When a decision matrix feels too binary
- Technology selection with many viable candidates
- Strategic decisions with complex trade-off surfaces
- When different stakeholders weight criteria differently

## Conversational Application

### Step 1: List All Options
Ask: "What are all the options on the table?"

Push for completeness:
- "Is there a hybrid option combining elements of A and B?"
- "What about the 'do nothing' option?"
- "What about the option you dismissed too quickly?"

Cap at 5 options. More than that means the problem isn't scoped well enough.

### Step 2: Define Evaluation Dimensions
Ask: "What dimensions matter for this decision?"

Suggested dimensions (pick 4-6 relevant ones):
- **Capability fit** — Does it do what we need?
- **Time to value** — How fast can we get results?
- **Total cost** — Implementation + ongoing maintenance
- **Team fit** — Does it match team skills and preferences?
- **Flexibility** — Can we change course later?
- **Risk profile** — What's the downside exposure?
- **Ecosystem** — Community, docs, integrations
- **Growth ceiling** — At what point does this stop working?

### Step 3: Set Dimension Weights
Ask: "Force-rank these dimensions. If you could only optimize for 2, which 2?"

Use tiered weighting:
- **Critical** (must-have) — Failing here eliminates the option
- **Important** (should-have) — Strongly influences the decision
- **Nice-to-have** — Tiebreaker only

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Option
For each option on each dimension, discuss:
- **Strong** — Clearly excels here
- **Adequate** — Meets needs, nothing special
- **Weak** — Significant concerns
- **Disqualifying** — Fails a critical dimension

Ask: "Walk me through why you'd rate option X as [strong/weak] on [dimension]."

### Step 5: Look for Patterns
After all evaluations:
- **Dominant option** — Strong on critical dimensions, adequate elsewhere
- **Polarized options** — Strong on different critical dimensions (reveals the real choice is between priorities)
- **Clustered options** — Multiple adequate options (pick the most reversible)
- **No winner** — Revisit whether the right options or dimensions are on the table

### Step 6: Sensitivity Analysis
Ask: "What would need to change for your second-choice option to become first?"

This reveals:
- How robust the leading option is
- What assumptions the decision depends on
- What to monitor after deciding

### Step 7: Make the Call
Ask: "Based on this analysis, what's your decision and your confidence level?"

If confidence is below 70%, consider:
- What additional information would increase confidence?
- Can you timebox a proof-of-concept?
- Can you make the decision reversible?

## Common Pitfalls
- Too many dimensions (leads to analysis paralysis)
- Equal weighting (avoids the hard prioritization)
- Anchoring on the first option evaluated
- Confusing familiarity with capability (knowing a tool =/= it being right)
