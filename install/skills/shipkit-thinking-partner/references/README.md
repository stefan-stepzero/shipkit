Cognitive frameworks and discussion styles for structured thinking.

## Frameworks

| Framework | Best For | File |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Decision Matrix | Binary or multi-option choices with clear criteria | `frameworks/decision-matrix.md` |
| First Principles | Challenging assumptions, rethinking from scratch | `frameworks/first-principles.md` |
| Pre-Mortem | Risk assessment, failure prevention | `frameworks/pre-mortem.md` |
| Consequence Mapping | Understanding ripple effects of decisions | `frameworks/consequence-mapping.md` |
| Devil's Advocate | Stress-testing a preferred option | `frameworks/devils-advocate.md` |
| Option Evaluation Rubric | Comparing multiple options across weighted dimensions | `frameworks/option-evaluation-rubric.md` |

## Discussion Styles

See `discussion-styles.md` for the three conversation modes:
- **Socratic** — Question-led discovery
- **Direct** — Structured analysis with clear recommendations
- **Framework-Guided** — Step-by-step framework application

## Framework Selection Guide

| Problem Pattern | Recommended Framework |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "Should we use A or B?" | Decision Matrix |
| "Why are we doing it this way?" | First Principles |
| "What could go wrong?" | Pre-Mortem |
| "What are the ripple effects?" | Consequence Mapping |
| "I'm leaning toward X..." | Devil's Advocate |
| "We have 3+ options to evaluate" | Option Evaluation Rubric |
| "I don't know where to start" | First Principles → then others |
