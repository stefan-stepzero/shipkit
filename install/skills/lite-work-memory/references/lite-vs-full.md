# When to Upgrade to Full /work-memory

## Lite is sufficient for:

- Solo developers or small teams
- POC/MVP projects
- Session-by-session tracking
- Simple "what did we do?" questions

---

## Upgrade to full /work-memory when:

- Need automatic metrics (LoC, complexity, coverage)
- Want git commit integration
- Require time tracking/velocity
- Managing multiple developers
- Need sprint/milestone planning
- Stakeholder reporting with charts

---

**Remember**: The goal is a simple, consistent log of what happened. Write entries as if you're explaining to future you what you did and why. Keep it brief but informative.
