# shipkit-scale-ready - Scale Readiness Audit

**Purpose**: Ensure your production system can handle growth and be operated reliably.

**Who this is for**: Teams with traction — you've launched, you have users, now you need to harden for scale.

**Prerequisite**: Preflight passed. This skill assumes MVP-level production readiness already exists.

---

## When to Invoke

**User triggers**:
- "Ready to scale"
- "Scale readiness check"
- "Production hardening"
- "Post-MVP audit"
- "We have traction, what should we fix?"
- "Enterprise readiness"

**Workflow position**:
- After MVP launch and user traction
- Before scaling marketing/growth efforts
- Before enterprise customers
- When transitioning from "it works" to "it's robust"

---

## The Two Tiers

| Tier | When | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| 🔶 **Growth** | Have traction, scaling up | Can handle 10x users, can debug prod issues |
| 🏢 **Enterprise** | Big customers, high stakes | Compliance, SLAs, operational maturity |

Default audit covers Growth tier. Enterprise tier on request or if context indicates enterprise customers.

---

## Process

### Completion Tracking

After determining scope, create tasks per audit category:
- `TaskCreate` for each applicable category (Security/DB, Observability/Perf, Reliability/Ops, Code Maturity, Compliance)
- `TaskCreate`: "Merge all subagent results"
- `TaskCreate`: "Write scale-readiness.json"
- `TaskCreate`: "Archive previous audit (if full audit)"

Subagent results returning is NOT done — results must be merged, classified, and written to the JSON artifact. Do NOT skip the archive step.

### Step 0: Verify Prerequisites

```
1. Check if preflight passed recently
   - Read .shipkit/preflight.json
   - If blockers exist: "Fix preflight blockers first — run /preflight"

2. Load project context
   - .shipkit/stack.json — tech stack
   - .shipkit/why.json — scale expectations
   - .shipkit/architecture.json — key patterns
```

### Step 1: Determine Audit Scope

**Check for previous scale audit:**
```
1. Check if .shipkit/scale-readiness.json exists
2. If exists, get changes since last audit
3. Determine: FULL AUDIT vs INCREMENTAL
```

**Map stack to relevant categories:**

| Stack Includes | Check Categories |
|----------------|------------------|
| Database (any) | Database Optimization |
| External APIs | Reliability Patterns |
| Auth system | Security Hardening |
| Frontend | Performance |
| Any backend | Observability, Operational |

### Step 2: Run Checklist by Category

For each applicable category, run checks and classify as:
- ✅ **Pass** — Implemented correctly
- ⚠️ **Warning** — Partially implemented or could improve
- ❌ **Fail** — Missing or broken
- ⏭️ **N/A** — Not applicable to this stack
- 👤 **Human-Verify** — Claude cannot verify, human must check

**See**: `references/checklists/` for detailed check definitions.

**Index-Accelerated Audit** — Read `.shipkit/codebase-index.json` first:

1. `Read: .shipkit/codebase-index.json`
2. If index exists:
   - Use `framework` to skip N/A categories (e.g., skip database checks if no DB in stack)
   - Use `concepts` to direct each agent to relevant files
   - Use `configFiles` to identify what infrastructure is configured
   - Use `coreFiles` for prioritizing high-impact audit targets
3. If index doesn't exist → agents scan entire codebase as below

**USE PARALLEL SUBAGENTS BY CATEGORY** - For full audits, spawn multiple Explore agents in parallel:

```
Launch these Agent subagents IN PARALLEL (single message, multiple tool calls):

1. SECURITY & DATABASE AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit security hardening and database optimization in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Start from: auth=[concepts.auth files], database=[concepts.database files]. Config: [configFiles].']
   SECURITY: Check security headers (CSP, HSTS), session config, admin route protection,
   re-auth on sensitive actions, API key management.
   DATABASE: Check indexes on queries, N+1 patterns, connection pooling, slow query logging.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning/Human-Verify with file:line evidence for each check."

2. OBSERVABILITY & PERFORMANCE AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit observability and performance in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Entry points: [entryPoints]. Core files: [coreFiles]. Recently active: [recentlyActive].']
   OBSERVABILITY: Check structured logging vs console.log, log levels, request/correlation ID,
   error tracking context, health endpoint detail.
   PERFORMANCE: Check bundle size, code splitting, image optimization, caching headers,
   API response caching.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning/Human-Verify with file:line evidence for each check."

3. RELIABILITY & OPERATIONS AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit reliability patterns and operational readiness in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'API entry points: [entryPoints.api]. External service files: [concepts with external calls]. Config: [configFiles].']
   RELIABILITY: Check timeouts on external calls, retry with backoff, graceful degradation,
   idempotency keys, retriable jobs.
   OPERATIONS: Check for runbooks, rollback docs, zero-downtime deploy config, feature flags.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning/Human-Verify with file:line evidence for each check."

4. CODE MATURITY AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit code maturity and technical debt in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Core files: [coreFiles]. Recently active: [recentlyActive]. Directories: [directories].']
   Check: test coverage on critical paths, duplicate components, shared component usage,
   centralized types, TODO/FIXME in core flows, dependency vulnerabilities (npm audit).
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning with file:line evidence for each check."

5. COMPLIANCE AGENT (Enterprise tier only) (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit compliance patterns in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Concepts: [concepts]. Entry points: [entryPoints]. Focus on data handling paths.']
   Check: GDPR export endpoint, GDPR deletion flow, audit logging on sensitive actions,
   data retention cleanup jobs.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning/Human-Verify with file:line evidence for each check."
```

**Why parallel subagents**:
- Each category runs simultaneously → faster total execution
- Smaller scope per agent → more thorough checks within category
- Clear attribution → findings map directly to categories
- 8 categories × 5-6 checks each = 50+ checks parallelized efficiently

**When to use parallel subagents**:
- Full scale-ready audit
- Large codebase (50+ source files)

**When to scan manually (single thread)**:
- Incremental audit (few files changed)
- Single category focus (e.g., "just check security")

## Output Format

**Output format**: JSON — machine-readable by other tools, and the single source of truth for scale readiness.

**Create file using Write tool**: `.shipkit/scale-readiness.json`

The output MUST conform to the schema below. This is a strict contract — other skills depend on this structure.

---

## JSON Schema

**Full schema**: See `references/output-schema.md`

## Context Files This Skill Reads

**Required**:
- `.shipkit/preflight.json` — Preflight must have passed
- `.shipkit/stack.json` — Tech stack

**Recommended**:
- `.shipkit/why.json` — Scale expectations
- `.shipkit/architecture.json` — Patterns and decisions
- `.shipkit/engineering-definition.json` — Mechanisms, components, design decisions
- `.shipkit/scale-readiness.json` — Previous audit (for incremental)

**Scans**:
- Source code for patterns
- Config files (CI/CD, Docker, etc.)
- Documentation (runbooks, etc.)

---

## Context Files This Skill Writes

**Write Strategy: OVERWRITE**

**Creates/Updates**:
- `.shipkit/scale-readiness.json` — Structured scale readiness audit (JSON artifact)

**Update Behavior**:
- File exists → Load previous audit, determine FULL vs INCREMENTAL
- Full audit → Archive old version first, then overwrite
- Incremental → Read existing, update changed categories only
- Each write REPLACES entire file contents

**Archives** (on full audit):
- `.shipkit/.archive/scale-readiness-[YYYY-MM-DD].json`

---

## Shipkit Artifact Convention

This skill follows the **Shipkit JSON artifact convention**. See `references/output-schema.md` for full documentation.

---

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| `/preflight` | Prerequisite — MVP readiness must pass first |
| `/verify` | Complements — verify is per-change, scale-ready is system-wide |
| `/shipkit-engineering-definition` | Reads — understands system patterns |
