# shipkit-verify

Batch verification — Claude reviews your work across quality dimensions and reports findings.

**Report only.** Doesn't fix, doesn't persist. User sees issues, decides what to address.

---

## When to Invoke

- `/verify` — review all recent changes
- `/verify <feature>` — focus on specific area
- "Check my work", "Am I ready to commit?"

**For deeper review:** If user asks for "deep check", "thorough review", or "really scrutinize this" → see [Deeper Review Option](#deeper-review-option) below.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Detect Scope

Determine what to verify:

```bash
# Get uncommitted changes
git diff --name-only HEAD

# If nothing uncommitted, check recent commits
git diff --name-only HEAD~3..HEAD
```

Also consider: What did Claude work on this session?

If unclear, ask: "What should I verify?"

### Step 1.5: Expand Scope via Pattern Ripple

Changed files may affect other files using the same patterns. Expand verification scope:

**USE SUBAGENT FOR PATTERN RIPPLE** - Launch Explore subagent for efficient parallel scanning:

```
Task tool with subagent_type: "Explore"
Prompt: "Detect pattern ripple from these changed files: [list files]

For each file, identify which patterns it uses:
- Auth: getSession, requireAuth, isAuthorized
- API Response: NextResponse, Response.json
- Error Handling: try/catch, .catch(
- Validation: zod, schema.parse
- Data Fetching: fetch, useSWR, useQuery

Then expand: find ALL other files using the same patterns.
Return: pattern type → list of affected files (both changed and ripple)."
```

**Why subagent**: Pattern ripple requires multiple parallel greps across the codebase. Explore agent handles this efficiently and returns a focused summary.

**Fallback** (if subagent unavailable) - Manual pattern detection:

| Pattern Type | Detection (in changed files) | Expansion (find all instances) |
|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Auth | `getSession\|requireAuth\|isAuthorized` | Grep all files with auth patterns |
| API Response | `NextResponse\|Response.json` | Glob all API routes |
| Error Handling | `try\s*{\|\.catch\(` | Grep async code for consistency |
| Validation | `zod\|schema\.parse` | Grep all form/input handlers |
| Data Fetching | `fetch\(\|useSWR\|useQuery` | Grep all data fetching code |

**Expansion logic:**

1. For each changed file, grep for pattern indicators
2. If pattern detected, expand scope:
   - Auth pattern → `Grep: pattern="getSession|requireAuth|isAuthorized" glob="**/*.{ts,tsx}"`
   - API route changed → `Glob: pattern="**/api/**/route.{ts,js}"`
   - Validation pattern → `Grep: pattern="zod|schema\.parse" glob="**/*.{ts,tsx}"`
3. Add ALL matches to verification scope
4. Mark as `RIPPLE:pattern-type` in output

**Scope categories:**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CHANGED` | Files in git diff (always checked) |
| `RIPPLE:auth` | All files using auth patterns |
| `RIPPLE:api` | All API routes (check consistent response shapes) |
| `RIPPLE:error` | Files with error handling patterns |
| `RIPPLE:validation` | Files with validation schemas |

**Report ripple scope in output:**

```
Reviewed: 3 changed + 7 ripple files
- Changed: src/api/trips/route.ts, src/lib/auth.ts, src/components/Form.tsx
- Ripple (auth): +4 files (detected auth pattern change)
- Ripple (api): +3 files (detected API route change)
```

**When to expand:**
- Auth file changed → Check ALL auth usages for consistency
- API route changed → Check other routes for response shape consistency
- Validation schema changed → Check all forms using that schema
- Error handling pattern changed → Check all async code for consistency

**When NOT to expand:**
- Simple typo fix in a comment
- Style-only changes
- Test file changes (contained scope)

### Step 2: Read Context

Load relevant context for the review:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Changed files | The actual code to review |
| `.shipkit/specs/active/*` | Check spec compliance |
| `.shipkit/architecture.md` | Check pattern consistency |
| `.shipkit/codebase-index.json` | Find related code |

### Step 3: Work Through Quality Dimensions

Review changes against these 12 dimensions, emphasizing based on what changed:

---

## The 12 Quality Dimensions

### 1. Structural Integrity
- Orphan code (defined but never used)
- Missing wiring (component exists but not rendered, route not registered)
- Broken imports (importing deleted/moved file)
- Circular dependencies
- Incomplete refactors (changed in one place, not others)

### 2. Spec & Intent Alignment
- Implementation matches active spec
- All acceptance criteria covered
- Edge cases from spec handled
- Feature actually solves the stated problem

### 3. Error Resilience
- Unhandled promise rejections
- Missing try/catch on async operations
- Empty/null/undefined states not handled
- API failure handling missing
- Missing error boundaries (React)
- Errors swallowed silently

### 4. State & Data
- Race conditions possible
- Stale cache / state issues
- Missing loading states
- Optimistic updates without rollback
- N+1 query patterns

### 5. Security
- Auth checks missing on new routes
- Input validation/sanitization missing
- Raw SQL queries (injection risk)
- Secrets/credentials in code
- XSS vulnerabilities
- IDOR (accessing other users' data)

### 6. Edge Cases
- Empty state not handled (zero items)
- Boundary values (0, negative, very large)
- Unicode/special characters
- Timezone issues
- Concurrent access scenarios

### 7. Performance Landmines
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization where needed
- Heavy dependency for light use (moment.js for one format)
- Unoptimized queries
- Missing pagination on lists

### 8. UX Completeness
- Missing loading indicators
- No feedback on user actions
- Broken/incomplete flows
- Missing confirmation on destructive actions
- Inconsistent patterns vs rest of app

### 9. Maintainability
- Magic numbers/strings
- Duplicated logic (same thing multiple ways)
- Confusing/misleading naming
- Missing types on public interfaces
- TODOs/FIXMEs left behind
- console.logs left in

### 10. Environment & Config
- New env vars not documented
- Hardcoded URLs/endpoints
- Works locally but will break in prod
- Docker/CI config not updated for new deps
- Missing feature flags for WIP features

### 11. API Contract
- Breaking changes to existing endpoints
- Inconsistent response shapes
- Missing input validation
- Undocumented new endpoints
- Version compatibility issues

### 12. Database Integrity
- Schema changes without migrations
- Missing indexes on query patterns
- Orphan records possible (no cascading delete)
- Data type mismatches
- Missing foreign key constraints

## Verification Integrity Protocol

**Critical Rule: Never claim without evidence.**

Every finding MUST be backed by actual tool output. Claims like "file not created" or "component unused" without verification are verification theater.

### The 5-Step Verification Gate

Before reporting ANY finding, execute these steps:

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. IDENTIFY** | What tool call proves this claim? | "I need to confirm `UserCard` is unused" |
| **2. RUN** | Execute the tool call | `Grep: pattern="UserCard" glob="**/*.{ts,tsx}"` |
| **3. READ** | Examine full output | "Found 2 matches: definition + one import" |
| **4. CLASSIFY** | Determine exact state from evidence | "CREATED_USED (imported in Dashboard.tsx:14)" |
| **5. REPORT** | State finding WITH evidence | "UserCard is imported in Dashboard.tsx:14" |

### Language Precision Rules

Use precise language that matches verification evidence:

| Claim | Required Evidence | Tool |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| "File not created" | Glob returns empty | `Glob: pattern="**/UserCard.*"` |
| "File exists but unused" | Glob finds file AND Grep for imports returns 0 | Glob + Grep |
| "Component orphaned" | File exists + no imports + no exports used | Glob + Grep |
| "Import broken" | Import statement exists + target file missing | Read + Glob |
| "Missing wiring" | Component exists + not rendered/registered anywhere | Grep for component usage |
| "Circular dependency" | A imports B AND B imports A | Read both files |

**Never say:**
- ❌ "This file is not used" (without grepping for imports)
- ❌ "This component doesn't exist" (without globbing)
- ❌ "The route is missing" (without checking route registration)

**Always say:**
- ✅ "Grep for `UserCard` returned 0 matches → unused"
- ✅ "Glob for `**/auth-callback.*` returned empty → not created"
- ✅ "Found `import UserCard` but Glob for UserCard.tsx returned empty → broken import"

### State Classification

Classify each finding into ONE of these states:

| State | Definition | Evidence Pattern |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| `NOT_CREATED` | File/component doesn't exist | Glob returns empty |
| `CREATED_UNUSED` | File exists but nothing imports/uses it | Glob finds file + Grep returns 0 imports |
| `CREATED_WRONG` | File exists but implementation doesn't match spec | Read file + compare to spec |
| `WIRING_MISSING` | Component exists but not connected to app | Grep for render/route registration returns 0 |
| `BROKEN_IMPORT` | Import statement points to nonexistent file | Read shows import + Glob for target returns empty |
| `CIRCULAR` | Mutual imports between files | Read both files show cross-imports |
| `STALE` | File exists but outdated vs related files | Compare timestamps or content |

### Evidence Requirements by Dimension

**Structural Integrity (Dimension 1):**
```
Orphan code:
  1. Glob: Find the file (confirm exists)
  2. Grep: Search for imports/uses of exported symbols
  3. If Grep returns 0: CREATED_UNUSED

Missing wiring:
  1. Glob: Confirm component exists
  2. Grep: Search for render/registration (JSX tags, route config)
  3. If Grep returns 0: WIRING_MISSING

Broken imports:
  1. Read: Find import statements
  2. For each import, Glob: Does target exist?
  3. If Glob returns empty: BROKEN_IMPORT
```

**Error Resilience (Dimension 3):**
```
Unhandled async:
  1. Grep: pattern="await " in changed files
  2. Read: Context around each await
  3. Check: Is it wrapped in try/catch?
  4. Report: file:line for unwrapped awaits
```

**Security (Dimension 5):**
```
Hardcoded secrets:
  1. Grep: pattern="(password|secret|key|token)\s*[:=]\s*['\"]"
  2. Exclude: .env files, test fixtures
  3. Report: file:line for matches
```

**Spec Alignment (Dimension 2):**
```
Acceptance criteria check:
  1. Read: Active spec file
  2. Extract: Each acceptance criterion
  3. For each criterion:
     - Grep/Read: Find implementing code
     - Verify: Does implementation satisfy criterion?
  4. Report: Which criteria verified vs not found
```

### Updated Output Format

Each finding MUST include evidence:

```
### 🔴 Critical (fix before commit)

**Structural: Orphan component** [CREATED_UNUSED]
- Evidence: `Glob("**/UserCard.tsx")` → found at src/components/UserCard.tsx
- Evidence: `Grep("UserCard" in "**/*.{ts,tsx}")` → 1 match (definition only)
- File: `src/components/UserCard.tsx`
- Classification: CREATED_UNUSED (exported but never imported)
- Impact: Dead code, likely incomplete feature

**Structural: Broken import** [BROKEN_IMPORT]
- Evidence: `Read("src/pages/Dashboard.tsx")` line 5: `import { AuthCard } from './AuthCard'`
- Evidence: `Glob("**/AuthCard.*")` → 0 matches
- File: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx:5`
- Classification: BROKEN_IMPORT (import target doesn't exist)
- Impact: Will cause runtime error
```

### Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Assumption without verification:**
```
"The UserCard component appears unused"
→ No Grep was run to verify
```

❌ **Vague classification:**
```
"There might be issues with the auth flow"
→ No specific finding, no evidence, no file:line
```

❌ **Tool mention without execution:**
```
"You should check if UserCard is imported anywhere"
→ YOU should check, not tell user to check
```

❌ **Conflating states:**
```
"UserCard is missing"
→ Missing = not created? Or created but not wired? Different fixes.
```

✅ **Correct pattern:**
```
1. Run Glob to confirm file exists
2. Run Grep to check for usage
3. Classify: NOT_CREATED / CREATED_UNUSED / WIRING_MISSING
4. Report with evidence and file:line
```

**See `references/detection-patterns.md` for Glob/Grep patterns by issue type.**

## Contextual Emphasis

Not all dimensions every time. Emphasize based on what changed:

| Changes In | Emphasize |
|------------|-----------|
| Auth/middleware | Security, Error Resilience |
| UI components | UX Completeness, Performance, Edge Cases |
| API routes | API Contract, Security, Error Resilience |
| Database/models | Database Integrity, State & Data |
| Config/env files | Environment & Config |
| Refactoring | Structural Integrity, Maintainability |
| New feature | Spec Alignment, all dimensions lightly |

---

## Output Format

Ephemeral report with clear priorities:

```
## Verification Report

Reviewed: 5 files (src/api/auth/*, src/middleware/*)
Context: Auth feature implementation

### 🔴 Critical (fix before commit)

**Security: Missing auth check**
- `src/api/users/[id]/route.ts` — endpoint accessible without auth
- Impact: Any user can access any other user's data

**Error Resilience: Unhandled rejection**
- `src/api/auth/login.ts:34` — await without try/catch
- Impact: Will crash on invalid credentials

### 🟡 Should Fix

**Structural: Orphan code**
- `src/utils/oldAuth.ts` — exported but never imported
- Likely leftover from refactor

**UX: Missing loading state**
- `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` — no loading indicator during submit

### 🟢 Minor / Consider

**Maintainability: Magic string**
- `src/api/auth/login.ts:12` — hardcoded "7d" for token expiry
- Consider: `const TOKEN_EXPIRY = "7d"`

---

2 critical | 2 should fix | 2 minor

💡 For deeper review: /code-review (4 agents) or /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr (6 agents)
```

---

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical | Will cause bugs, security issues, or crashes | Fix before commit |
| 🟡 Should Fix | Quality issues, tech debt, incomplete work | Fix soon |
| 🟢 Minor | Suggestions, nice-to-haves, style | Consider |

---

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Fix issues** — report only, user decides what to address
- **Block commits** — informational, not a gate
- **Persist results** — ephemeral output only
- **Run linters/tests** — this is Claude reasoning, not tooling
- **Guarantee completeness** — best effort review

---

## Context Files This Skill Reads

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Git diff | What changed |
| `.shipkit/specs/active/*` | Check spec compliance |
| `.shipkit/architecture.md` | Check pattern consistency |
| `.shipkit/codebase-index.json` | Find related code |
| Source files | The actual code |

---

## Context Files This Skill Writes

None. This is a read-only reporting tool.

---

## Deeper Review Options

This skill provides a **fast single-pass review** — good for daily use.

For **thorough multi-agent review**, two plugins are available:

| Plugin | Agents | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `code-review` | 4 parallel | Standard deep review |
| `pr-review-toolkit` | 6 parallel | Maximum scrutiny |

```bash
# Install (once)
/plugin install code-review@claude-code-plugins
/plugin install pr-review-toolkit@claude-code-plugins

# Use
/code-review                      # 4-agent review
/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr      # 6-agent deep analysis
```

**When to use deeper review:**
- Before merging to main
- Complex changes touching multiple systems
- Security-sensitive code
- When fast verify flags concerns worth investigating further

**Trade-off:** 4-6x token cost, slower, but catches more subtle issues.

<!-- SECTION:after-completion -->
## After Completion

Report is delivered. User decides next steps:
- Fix critical issues (ask Claude to help)
- Defer should-fix items
- Ignore minor suggestions
- Proceed with commit

**Want deeper scrutiny?** Use `/code-review` (4 agents) or `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` (6 agents) — requires plugins.
