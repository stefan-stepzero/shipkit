## Who Is This For?

Solo developers building side projects who want structure without complexity. People who have good ideas but get lost in implementation without a framework.

---

## Why Does This Exist?

Claude Code is powerful but forgets everything between sessions. Developers waste 10-15 minutes every session re-explaining their stack, architecture decisions, and project goals. This framework gives Claude persistent memory.

---

## Where Are We Now?

Early MVP with 18 lite skills. Being tested by a handful of developers on POCs and side projects. Core patterns proven, ready to expand.

---

## Where Do We Need To Be?

Stable Lite edition with 20 skills, used by 100+ developers daily. Full edition ready for teams working on complex greenfield products. Solid documentation so anyone can install and use it.

---

## How Are We Getting There?

Ship quickly, iterate based on user feedback. Keep Lite simple (prompt-driven, no bash complexity). Make Full comprehensive (full product discovery + dev workflow). Document everything as we build.

---

## Constraints & Priorities

**Constraints:**
- Solo maintainer with limited time (~10 hours/week)
- Must work cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- No external dependencies (just Claude Code + Python)

**Priorities:**
1. Speed of execution (ship fast, iterate)
2. Developer experience (make it obvious)
3. Documentation (make it learnable)
```

---

**Remember**: This is strategic context, not requirements. Keep it high-level. Answer "why" not "how". Think vision, not spec. Claude will use this to make better decisions aligned with your goals.
