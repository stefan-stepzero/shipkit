# Difference from Full ShipKit

| Aspect | Full ShipKit (prod-*) | lite-why-project |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Time to complete** | 2-4 hours (10 skills) | 2-5 minutes (5 questions) |
| **Detail level** | Comprehensive product discovery | High-level strategic overview |
| **Output files** | 10+ files (personas, JTBD, market, brand, stories, etc.) | 1 file (why.md) |
| **When to use** | Greenfield products needing validation | POCs, MVPs, side projects |
| **Update frequency** | Rarely (major pivots only) | Anytime vision evolves |
| **Session loading** | Not auto-loaded (too large) | Auto-loads (~150 tokens) |

- Internal tools
- When you just need alignment, not validation

---

## Use full ShipKit prod-* skills for:

- Startups raising funding
- Products needing market validation
- B2B SaaS with complex user types
- When you need detailed product artifacts
- Enterprise products
