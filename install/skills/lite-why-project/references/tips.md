# Tips for Effective Vision Definition

## Keep it concise

- 1-3 sentences per question
- High-level, not detailed
- Strategic, not tactical

---

## Be honest

- "Learning project" is valid
- "Just for me" is valid
- "No deadline" is valid

## Think about Claude's decisions

Your answers will influence every suggestion Claude makes:
- Example: "Priority: speed" → Claude suggests simpler solutions
- Example: "Priority: learning" → Claude suggests educational approaches

---

## Update when things change

- Pivot from solo to team? Update.
- Shift from POC to production? Update.
- Changed priorities? Update.

---

## Share with team

- why.md is onboarding documentation
- Gets everyone aligned on vision
- Reference it in discussions

## When NOT to Use This Skill

**Skip lite-why-project if:**
- You're doing a 10-minute code spike (too small)
- You're modifying someone else's codebase (not your vision to define)
- You're following strict requirements (vision already defined elsewhere)

**Use full ShipKit prod-* skills if:**
- Raising funding (need comprehensive business case)
- Validating market (need market analysis)
- Complex product (need detailed personas, JTBD)
- B2B SaaS (need multiple user types mapped)
