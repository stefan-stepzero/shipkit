# shipkit-preflight - Production Readiness Audit

**Purpose**: Ensure your project is actually ready for real users — not just working on localhost.

**What it does**: Aggregates context from existing skills, identifies gaps, runs a comprehensive SaaS production checklist, and generates a prioritized audit report.

---

## When to Invoke

**User triggers**:
- "Am I ready to ship?"
- "Production readiness check"
- "Preflight", "Go live check"
- "Is this ready for users?"
- "Launch checklist"

**For thorough mode** (deep code review per partition):
- "Thorough preflight", "Deep preflight"
- "Really scrutinize before launch"
- → See [Thorough Mode](#thorough-mode-deep-code-review) section

**Workflow position**:
- After features are implemented
- Before deploying to production
- When transitioning from "it works" to "it's shippable"

---

## Prerequisites

This skill aggregates context from other skills. It will route you to create missing context.

| Needed Context | Source Skill | File | Required? |
|----------------|--------------|------|-----------|
| Tech stack, deployment target | `/shipkit-project-context` | `stack.md` | Yes |
| Vision, constraints, scale | `/shipkit-why-project` | `why.md` | Yes |
| Architecture decisions, auth model | `/shipkit-architecture-memory` | `architecture.md` | Recommended |
| Data shapes, what's stored | `/shipkit-data-contracts` | `types.md` | Recommended |
| Feature specs | `/shipkit-spec` | `specs/active/*.md` | Helpful |

**If missing required context**: Skill will route you to the appropriate skill first.

---

## Process

### Step 0: Determine Audit Scope (Full vs Incremental)

**Check for previous audit:**

```
1. Check if .shipkit/production-readiness.md exists

2. If exists, extract metadata:
   - Last run timestamp
   - Commit hash at last run
   - Previous findings (passed/failed/warned)

3. Get changes since last audit:
   git diff <last-commit>..HEAD --name-only

4. Determine scope:
   - No previous audit → FULL AUDIT
   - No changes since last audit → QUICK VERIFY (re-check failures only)
   - Changes detected → INCREMENTAL AUDIT (focus on changed areas)
```

**Map changed files to checklist categories:**

| Files Changed | Re-check Categories |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `**/auth/**`, `**/middleware/**`, `**/login/**` | Auth & Security |
| `**/api/**`, `**/routes/**` | API, Error Handling |
| `**/*.sql`, `**/migrations/**`, `**/prisma/**` | Database |
| `**/components/**`, `**/pages/**`, `**/app/**` | UX Resilience |
| `.env*`, `**/config/**` | Environment |
| `Dockerfile`, `vercel.json`, `railway.*` | Deployment |
| `**/payment/**`, `**/billing/**`, `**/webhook/**` | Payments |

**Communicate scope to user:**
```
Since last preflight (a1b2c3d, 3 days ago):
- 12 files changed
- Categories affected: Auth, Database, Error Handling
- Running incremental audit...
```

---

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites (if Full Audit)

**Skip to Step 3 if incremental audit with all prerequisites already met.**

**Read existing context files:**

```
1. Check .shipkit/stack.md
   - Missing? → "Run /shipkit-project-context first — I need to know your stack and deployment target"
   - Exists but no deployment target? → Ask: "Where are you deploying? (Vercel, AWS, Railway, Docker, etc.)"

2. Check .shipkit/why.md
   - Missing? → "Run /shipkit-why-project first — I need to understand scale and constraints"
   - Exists → Extract: expected users, data sensitivity, uptime requirements

3. Check .shipkit/architecture.md
   - Missing? → Note: "No architecture decisions documented — will use generic checks"
   - Exists → Extract: auth model, database choices, key patterns

4. Check .shipkit/types.md
   - Missing? → Note: "No data contracts — will infer from code"
   - Exists → Extract: what sensitive data is stored
```

**If required files missing**: Stop and route to prerequisite skill.

---

### Step 2: Gap Analysis (Minimal Intake)

**Only ask what's NOT captured in existing files:**

Possible questions (only if not already documented):

1. **Deployment target** (if not in stack.md):
   - "Where are you deploying? (Vercel, Railway, AWS, Docker, self-hosted)"

2. **Expected scale** (if not in why.md):
   - "Expected concurrent users at launch? (just me, <100, 100-1000, 1000+)"

3. **Data sensitivity** (if not in types.md):
   - "What's the most sensitive data you store? (none, emails, PII, payments, healthcare)"

4. **Current state**:
   - "Is this a fresh launch or adding features to a live product?"

**Store answers in audit context** (not persisted separately — these inform THIS audit).

---

### Step 3: Run Audit Against Checklist

**Load checklist sections based on context AND scope:**

| If Context Shows | Load Checklist Sections |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Auth in stack | `auth-checks.md` |
| Payments (Stripe, Lemon Squeezy) | `payment-checks.md` |
| Database (Supabase, Postgres) | `database-checks.md` |
| Deployment target known | `deployment-checks.md` (target-specific) |
| PII or sensitive data | `data-privacy-checks.md` |
| All projects | `universal-checks.md` |

**See**: `references/checklists/` for full checklist content.

**For FULL AUDIT:**
- Run all applicable checks
- Scan entire codebase for evidence
- Mark as: ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Warning | ❌ Fail | ⏭️ N/A

**For INCREMENTAL AUDIT:**
```
1. Re-check categories affected by changed files
   - Full scan of changed files
   - Mark as: ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Warning | ❌ Fail

2. Re-verify previous failures
   - Check if previously failed items now pass
   - Mark as: ✅ NOW FIXED | ❌ Still failing

3. Skip unchanged categories
   - Note as: ⏭️ Unchanged since last audit
   - Carry forward previous status

4. Quick spot-check unchanged passing items (optional)
   - Verify critical items haven't regressed
   - Only if explicitly requested
```

**For QUICK VERIFY (no changes):**
- Only re-check previously failed/warned items
- Report if issues still exist or now fixed

---

### Step 4: Generate Audit Report

**Create**: `.shipkit/production-readiness.md`

**Report structure (with tracking metadata):**

```markdown
# Production Readiness Audit

<!-- PREFLIGHT METADATA - DO NOT EDIT -->
<!-- last_run: 2024-01-15T14:32:00Z -->
<!-- commit: a1b2c3d4e5f6 -->

## Context Files This Skill Reads

**For incremental audit**:
- `.shipkit/production-readiness.md` — Previous audit with metadata (commit hash, findings)
- Git history — `git diff <last-commit>..HEAD --name-only`

**Required (full audit)**:
- `.shipkit/stack.md` — Tech stack, deployment target
- `.shipkit/why.md` — Vision, constraints, scale expectations

**Recommended**:
- `.shipkit/architecture.md` — Auth model, key decisions
- `.shipkit/types.md` — Data shapes, sensitive fields
- `.shipkit/specs/active/*.md` — Feature requirements

**Scans**:
- Source code files based on stack (or just changed files for incremental)
- `package.json` / `requirements.txt` — Dependencies
- `.env.example` — Environment documentation
- Config files based on deployment target

---

## Context Files This Skill Writes

**Write Strategy**: OVERWRITE with ARCHIVE (full audit) or UPDATE-IN-PLACE (incremental)

**Creates/Updates**:
- `.shipkit/production-readiness.md` — Current audit report with metadata header:
  ```
  <!-- PREFLIGHT METADATA -->
  <!-- last_run: ISO timestamp -->
  <!-- commit: git commit hash -->
  <!-- scope: full|incremental|quick-verify -->
  <!-- END METADATA -->
  ```

**Archives** (full audit only):
- `.shipkit/audits/production-readiness-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` — Previous audits

**Why track metadata**:
- Enable incremental audits (know what changed since last run)
- Track progress over time ("last audit had 12 blockers, now 3")
- Identify regressions (was passing, now fails)
- See what was flagged before

## When This Skill Integrates with Others

### Routes TO (when prerequisites missing)

| Missing | Routes To |
|---------|-----------|
| stack.md | `/shipkit-project-context` |
| why.md | `/shipkit-why-project` |
| architecture.md | `/shipkit-architecture-memory` (suggests, doesn't require) |
| types.md | `/shipkit-data-contracts` (suggests, doesn't require) |

### After This Skill

- User fixes blockers (natural capability — no skill needed)
- Re-run `/shipkit-preflight` to verify fixes
- Proceed with deployment

### Differs From

- `/shipkit-verify` — Code quality on recent changes (pre-commit)
- `/shipkit-preflight` — Production readiness (pre-launch)

---

<!-- SECTION:after-completion -->
## After Completion

**Audit delivered. User decides next steps:**

1. **Fix blockers** — Ask Claude to help fix specific issues
2. **Review warnings** — Decide which to address now vs later
3. **Re-run audit** — Verify fixes resolved the issues
4. **Proceed with launch** — If no blockers remain

**Natural capabilities** (no skill needed): Implementing fixes for identified issues.

**Suggest re-running** when significant fixes have been made.

## Thorough Mode (Deep Code Review)

The standard preflight is a **checklist-based audit** — fast, broad coverage.

For **maximum scrutiny**, use the `pr-review-toolkit` plugin to deep-review the entire codebase:

### Process

1. **Partition codebase into MECE chunks** using codebase-index concepts:
   ```
   Read .shipkit/codebase-index.json

   Example partitions:
   - auth (src/auth/**, src/middleware/auth*)
   - api (src/api/**)
   - database (src/db/**, src/models/**)
   - ui (src/components/**, src/pages/**)
   - config (src/config/**, *.config.*)
   ```

2. **Run pr-review-toolkit on each partition** with project context:
   ```
   For each partition:
   - Provide: partition files + codebase-index summary + architecture.md
   - Run: /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr
   - Collect: findings
   ```

3. **Aggregate findings** into preflight report by category

### When to Use

- Pre-launch of critical product
- After major refactor
- Security audit
- When standard preflight flags multiple concerns

### Trade-off

| Mode | Coverage | Depth | Cost |
|------|----------|-------|------|
| Standard | Entire project | Checklist scan | ~1 call |
| Thorough | Entire project | Deep per-partition | ~6 calls × N partitions |

### Installation

```bash
/plugin install pr-review-toolkit@claude-code-plugins
```

Then ask: "Run thorough preflight with deep code review"
