# shipkit-preflight - MVP Production Readiness Audit

**Purpose**: Ensure your project is ready for first users — the essentials that can't wait.

**What it does**: Runs an MVP-focused production checklist covering security, data integrity, error handling, UX basics, and legal compliance. Generates `.shipkit/preflight.json` with structured results. For scale/enterprise readiness (observability, performance, operational maturity), use `/shipkit-scale-ready` after you have traction.

**Output format**: JSON — readable by Claude, machine-readable by other tools, and the single source of truth for production readiness status.

**Philosophy**: With AI dev, building is cheap — but security, data integrity, and user trust aren't. This checklist keeps what matters for MVP while deferring optimization concerns.

---

## When to Invoke

**User triggers**:
- "Am I ready to ship?"
- "Production readiness check"
- "Preflight", "Go live check"
- "Is this ready for users?"
- "Launch checklist"

**For thorough mode** (deep code review per partition):
- "Thorough preflight", "Deep preflight"
- "Really scrutinize before launch"
- → See [Thorough Mode](#thorough-mode-deep-code-review) section

**Workflow position**:
- After features are implemented
- Before deploying to production
- When transitioning from "it works" to "it's shippable"

---

## Prerequisites

This skill aggregates context from other skills. It will route you to create missing context.

| Needed Context | Source Skill | File | Required? |
|----------------|--------------|------|-----------|
| Tech stack, deployment target | `/shipkit-project-context` | `stack.json` | Yes |
| Vision, constraints, scale | `/shipkit-why-project` | `why.json` | Yes |
| Architecture decisions, auth model | `/shipkit-engineering-definition` | `architecture.json` | Recommended |
| Data shapes, what's stored | `/shipkit-engineering-definition` | `engineering-definition.json` | Recommended |
| Feature specs | `/shipkit-spec` | `specs/active/*.json` | Helpful |

**If missing required context**: Skill will route you to the appropriate skill first.

---

## Process

### Completion Tracking

After determining audit scope, create tasks for each checklist category being audited:
- `TaskCreate` for each applicable category (e.g., "Audit: Auth", "Audit: Data", "Audit: Error Handling", etc.)
- `TaskCreate`: "Write preflight.json"
- `TaskCreate`: "Archive previous audit (if exists)"

Do NOT present results until all applicable category tasks AND the file-write task show completed.

### Step 0: Determine Audit Scope (Full vs Incremental)

**Check for previous audit:**

```
1. Check if .shipkit/preflight.json exists

2. If exists, extract metadata:
   - Last run timestamp
   - Commit hash at last run
   - Previous findings (passed/failed/warned)

3. Get changes since last audit:
   git diff <last-commit>..HEAD --name-only

4. Determine scope:
   - No previous audit → FULL AUDIT
   - No changes since last audit → QUICK VERIFY (re-check failures only)
   - Changes detected → INCREMENTAL AUDIT (focus on changed areas)
```

**Map changed files to checklist categories:**

| Files Changed | Re-check Categories |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `**/auth/**`, `**/middleware/**`, `**/login/**` | Auth & Security |
| `**/api/**`, `**/routes/**` | API, Error Handling |
| `**/*.sql`, `**/migrations/**`, `**/prisma/**` | Database |
| `**/components/**`, `**/pages/**`, `**/app/**` | UX Resilience |
| `.env*`, `**/config/**` | Environment |
| `Dockerfile`, `vercel.json`, `railway.*` | Deployment |
| `**/payment/**`, `**/billing/**`, `**/webhook/**` | Payments |
| `**/shared/**`, `**/common/**`, `**/features/**/components/**` | Code Structure & Reuse |
| `**/lib/**`, `**/services/**`, files importing external SDKs | External Service Boundaries |

**Communicate scope to user:**
```
Since last preflight (a1b2c3d, 3 days ago):
- 12 files changed
- Categories affected: Auth, Database, Error Handling
- Running incremental audit...
```

---

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites (if Full Audit)

**Skip to Step 3 if incremental audit with all prerequisites already met.**

**Read existing context files:**

```
1. Check .shipkit/stack.json
   - Missing? → "Run /shipkit-project-context first — I need to know your stack and deployment target"
   - Exists but no deployment target? → Ask: "Where are you deploying? (Vercel, AWS, Railway, Docker, etc.)"

2. Check .shipkit/why.json
   - Missing? → "Run /shipkit-why-project first — I need to understand scale and constraints"
   - Exists → Extract: expected users, data sensitivity, uptime requirements

3. Check .shipkit/architecture.json
   - Missing? → Note: "No architecture decisions documented — will use generic checks"
   - Exists → Extract: auth model, database choices, key patterns

4. Check .shipkit/engineering-definition.json `components[].dataContracts`
   - Missing? → Note: "No data contracts — will infer from code"
   - Exists → Extract: what sensitive data flows through component boundaries
```

**If required files missing**: Stop and route to prerequisite skill.

---

### Step 2: Gap Analysis (Minimal Intake)

**Only ask what's NOT captured in existing files:**

Possible questions (only if not already documented):

1. **Deployment target** (if not in stack.json):
   - "Where are you deploying? (Vercel, Railway, AWS, Docker, self-hosted)"

2. **Expected scale** (if not in why.json):
   - "Expected concurrent users at launch? (just me, <100, 100-1000, 1000+)"

3. **Data sensitivity** (if not in engineering-definition.json):
   - "What's the most sensitive data you store? (none, emails, PII, payments, healthcare)"

4. **Current state**:
   - "Is this a fresh launch or adding features to a live product?"

**Store answers in audit context** (not persisted separately — these inform THIS audit).

---

### Step 3: Run Audit Against Checklist

**Load checklist sections based on context AND scope:**

| If Context Shows | Load Checklist Sections |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Auth in stack | `auth-checks.md` |
| Payments (Stripe, Lemon Squeezy) | `payment-checks.md` |
| Database (Supabase, Postgres) | `database-checks.md` |
| Deployment target known | `deployment-checks.md` (target-specific) |
| PII or sensitive data | `data-privacy-checks.md` |
| External services (LLM, payment, storage) | `universal-checks.md` → External Service Boundaries section |
| All projects | `universal-checks.md` |

**See**: `references/checklists/` for full checklist content.

**Index-Accelerated Audit** — Read `.shipkit/codebase-index.json` first:

1. `Read: .shipkit/codebase-index.json`
2. If index exists:
   - Use `framework` to select applicable checklist sections (skip N/A categories)
   - Use `concepts` to direct each agent to relevant files (e.g., AUTH agent gets `concepts.auth` files, DATA agent gets `concepts.database` files)
   - Use `entryPoints` and `coreFiles` to prioritize high-impact areas
3. If index doesn't exist → agents scan entire codebase as below

**USE PARALLEL SUBAGENTS BY CATEGORY** - For full audits, spawn multiple Explore agents in parallel:

```
Launch these Task agents IN PARALLEL (single message, multiple tool calls):

1. AUTH & SECURITY AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit authentication and security patterns in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Start from these files: [concepts.auth files]. Entry points: [entryPoints]. Core files: [coreFiles].']
   Check: auth on protected routes, session expiry, CSRF protection, rate limiting,
   secrets in env vars, input validation, brute force prevention, form abuse prevention.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning with file:line evidence for each check."

2. DATA & ERROR HANDLING AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit data integrity and error handling in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Start from: [concepts.database files]. Config: [configFiles].']
   Check: RLS policies (Supabase), cascade deletes, backup docs, try/catch on async,
   error boundaries, consistent API errors, retry logic, graceful degradation, error logging.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning with file:line evidence for each check."

3. UX & DEPLOYMENT AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit UX resilience and deployment readiness in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Start from: [entryPoints]. UI directories: [relevant directories].']
   Check: loading states, empty states, confirmation dialogs, form validation,
   mobile responsive, build passes, health endpoint, migrations, SSL, domain config.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning with file:line evidence for each check."

4. CODE QUALITY & COMPLIANCE AGENT (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit code structure, accessibility, and compliance in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Core files: [coreFiles]. Recently active: [recentlyActive].']
   Check: no duplicate components, shared components used, consistent naming,
   utils consolidated, types centralized, data-testid attributes, ARIA roles,
   Terms of Service link, Privacy Policy link, cookie consent.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning with file:line evidence for each check."

5. PAYMENTS AGENT (if applicable) (subagent_type: "Explore")
   Prompt: "Audit payment integration in this [stack] codebase.
   [If index exists, include: 'Start from: [concepts.payments files if present].']
   Check: webhook signature verification, idempotency, failed payment handling,
   subscription state sync, test mode disabled in prod.
   Report Pass/Fail/Warning with file:line evidence for each check."
```

**Why parallel subagents**:
- Each category runs simultaneously → faster total execution
- Smaller scope per agent → more thorough checks within category
- Better context management → agent stays focused on related patterns
- Clearer attribution → know which category each finding came from

**When to use parallel subagents**:
- Full audit with 3+ checklist categories
- Large codebase (50+ source files)
- Need thorough coverage

**When to scan manually (single thread)**:
- Quick verify (re-check failures only)
- Incremental audit (few files changed)
- Single category focus

**For FULL AUDIT:**
- Run all applicable checks (via subagent for efficiency)
- Scan entire codebase for evidence
- Mark as: ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Warning | ❌ Fail | ⏭️ N/A

**For INCREMENTAL AUDIT:**
```
1. Re-check categories affected by changed files
   - Full scan of changed files
   - Mark as: ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Warning | ❌ Fail

2. Re-verify previous failures
   - Check if previously failed items now pass
   - Mark as: ✅ NOW FIXED | ❌ Still failing

3. Skip unchanged categories
   - Note as: ⏭️ Unchanged since last audit
   - Carry forward previous status

4. Quick spot-check unchanged passing items (optional)
   - Verify critical items haven't regressed
   - Only if explicitly requested
```

**For QUICK VERIFY (no changes):**
- Only re-check previously failed/warned items
- Report if issues still exist or now fixed

---

### Step 3.5: Verification Protocol for Each Check

**Critical: Execute tools before marking Pass/Fail.**

Each checklist item describes what to "Scan for" — translate these to actual tool calls:

| Checklist Description | Tool Call | Pass Condition |
|----------------------|-----------|----------------|
| "Auth on protected routes" | `Grep: pattern="getSession\|requireAuth" path="src/app/api/**"` | All route files have auth |
| "Secrets in env vars" | `Grep: pattern="(secret\|key)[:=]['\"]" glob="**/*.{ts,tsx}"` | 0 matches in source |
| "Try/catch on async" | `Grep: pattern="await " -A=5` then check for try | All awaits wrapped |
| "Error boundaries" | `Grep: pattern="ErrorBoundary\|error\\.tsx" path="src/app"` | Found in layout/root |
| "Loading states" | `Grep: pattern="loading\|isLoading\|Skeleton" path="[component]"` | Found in async components |
| "Input validation" | `Grep: pattern="zod\|yup\|schema\\.parse" path="[form file]"` | Found in form handlers |

**Verification sequence for each check:**
1. **Execute** the appropriate Glob/Grep/Read
2. **Read** the output completely
3. **Classify** as Pass/Fail based on evidence
4. **Record** evidence in finding (file:line or "0 matches")

**Never mark a check without tool evidence.** If a checklist says "Scan for X" and you didn't actually scan, the check is incomplete.

---

### Step 4: Generate Audit Report

**Create**: `.shipkit/preflight.json`

**The output MUST conform to the schema in `references/output-schema.md`.** This is a strict contract — other skills depend on this structure.

---

## JSON Schema (Quick Reference)

```json
{
  "$schema": "shipkit-artifact",
  "type": "preflight",
  "version": "1.0",
  "lastUpdated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "source": "shipkit-preflight",
  "summary": { "overallStatus", "readinessScore", "scope", "commit", "counts", "byCategory" },
  "checks": [{ "id", "category", "name", "status", "evidence", "file", "line", "statusChange", "details" }],
  "blockers": [{ "checkId", "category", "name", "problem", "impact", "fix", "statusChange" }],
  "recommendations": [{ "checkId", "category", "name", "severity", "suggestion", "effort" }],
  "statusChanges": { "fixed", "newIssues", "regressions" },
  "auditHistory": [{ "date", "commit", "scope", "blockers", "warnings" }],
  "context": { "project", "stack", "deployment" }
}
```

**Full schema and field reference**: See `references/output-schema.md`

**Realistic example**: See `references/example.json`

### Determining Overall Status

- `"not-ready"` — Any blockers exist (checks with status `"fail"`)
- `"ready-with-warnings"` — No blockers, but recommendations exist (checks with status `"warning"`)
- `"ready"` — All checks pass or are not-applicable

---

### Step 5: Save and Present

**Archive previous** (if exists and doing full audit):
```bash
# Move existing to archive with date
.shipkit/preflight.json → .shipkit/audits/preflight-2024-01-15.json
```

**Write new**: `.shipkit/preflight.json` (conforming to JSON schema above)

**Output to user (Full Audit):**
```
✅ Preflight audit complete (full)

📊 Results: X passed | X warnings | X blockers

🔴 Blockers (must fix before launch):

## The Checklist Categories

### 1. Auth & Security
- Authentication on all protected routes
- Session management (expiry, refresh)
- Password requirements (if applicable)
- OAuth state parameter (if applicable)
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Secrets in environment variables (not code)
- Input sanitization
- **Brute force prevention** — lockout or delay after N failed login attempts (pattern: counter in DB, exponential backoff)
- **Form abuse prevention** — honeypot field + timing check on public forms (pattern: hidden field bots fill, reject < 2s submissions)

### 2. Data & Database
- RLS policies on all user tables (Supabase)
- Cascade deletes configured correctly
- Backup strategy documented

*Moved to scale-ready: soft deletes, indexes, data export, PII encryption*

### 3. Error Handling
- Try/catch on all async operations
- API error responses are consistent
- Error boundaries in UI (React)
- Failed request retry logic
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- User-friendly error messages (not stack traces)
- **Error visibility** — errors logged with context for debugging (pattern: structured error logging with user/request context; optional: error tracking service like Sentry free tier)

### 4. Environment & Config
- All env vars documented in .env.example
- No hardcoded URLs/endpoints
- Environment parity (dev ≈ prod)
- Feature flags for WIP features
- Secrets not in git history

### 5. Deployment
- Build passes without warnings
- Health check endpoint exists
- Migrations run automatically or documented
- SSL/HTTPS enforced
- Domain configured correctly

*Moved to scale-ready: rollback plan documented*

### 6. UX Resilience
- Loading states on all async operations
- Empty states handled
- Confirmation on destructive actions
- Form validation with clear errors
- Mobile responsive

*Moved to scale-ready: offline handling*

### 7. Payments (if applicable)
- Webhook signature verification
- Idempotency on payment operations
- Failed payment handling
- Subscription state synced with provider
- Test mode disabled in prod

*Moved to scale-ready: receipts/invoices*

### 8. Legal/Compliance
- Terms of Service link
- Privacy Policy link
- Cookie consent (if required)

*Moved to scale-ready: data retention policy, GDPR data export/deletion*

### 9. External Service Boundaries
- External API calls have timeout configuration
- Resource limits set on variable-output calls (LLM token limits, file size caps)
- Platform execution limits configured (maxDuration on serverless)
- Failure modes handled for each external service (timeout, rate limit, auth, outage)

### 10. Code Structure & Reuse
- **No duplicate components** (same component name in multiple feature directories)
- **Shared components used** (features import from shared/common/ui, not local copies)
- **Consistent naming** (no Modal vs Dialog vs Popup for same purpose)
- **Utils consolidated** (no duplicate hooks/helpers across features)
- **Types centralized** (shared types in one location, not scattered)

**Why critical**: Duplication creates maintenance burden, inconsistent UX, and makes global updates (like design system changes) painful. Ships technical debt.

### 11. AI Agent Accessibility
- Interactive elements have `data-testid` attributes
- Custom widgets have ARIA roles (`combobox`, `dialog`, `menu`, `tablist`)
- State exposed via attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-checked`, `data-state`)
- Form inputs have associated labels (explicit or `aria-label`)
- Dynamic content changes announced to screen readers

**Why critical**: Without these, AI-driven QA (Claude in Chrome, Playwright) cannot reliably interact with or verify UI. This blocks automated testing and accessibility compliance.

---

## Context Files This Skill Reads

**For incremental audit**:
- `.shipkit/preflight.json` — Previous audit with metadata (commit hash, findings)
- Git history — `git diff <last-commit>..HEAD --name-only`

**Required (full audit)**:
- `.shipkit/stack.json` — Tech stack, deployment target
- `.shipkit/why.json` — Vision, constraints, scale expectations

**Recommended**:
- `.shipkit/architecture.json` — Auth model, key decisions
- `.shipkit/engineering-definition.json` — Data contracts via `components[].dataContracts`
- `.shipkit/specs/active/*.json` — Feature requirements

**Optional** (consult if available):
- `.shipkit/prompt-audit.json` — LLM security findings from `/shipkit-prompt-audit`
- `.shipkit/scale-readiness.json` — Scalability concerns from `/shipkit-scale-ready`

**Scans**:
- Source code files based on stack (or just changed files for incremental)
- `package.json` / `requirements.txt` — Dependencies
- `.env.example` — Environment documentation
- Config files based on deployment target

---

## Context Files This Skill Writes

**Write Strategy**: OVERWRITE with ARCHIVE (full audit) or UPDATE-IN-PLACE (incremental)

**Creates/Updates**:
- `.shipkit/preflight.json` — Current audit report (JSON artifact with `$schema`, `type`, `version`, `lastUpdated`, `source`, `summary` fields)

**Archives** (full audit only):
- `.shipkit/audits/preflight-[YYYY-MM-DD].json` — Previous audits

**Why track metadata**:
- Enable incremental audits (know what changed since last run)
- Track progress over time ("last audit had 12 blockers, now 3")
- Identify regressions (was passing, now fails)
- See what was flagged before

---

## Shipkit Artifact Convention

This skill follows the **Shipkit JSON artifact convention**. See `references/output-schema.md` for the full convention details.

## When This Skill Integrates with Others

### Routes TO (when prerequisites missing)

| Missing | Routes To |
|---------|-----------|
| stack.json | `/shipkit-project-context` |
| why.json | `/shipkit-why-project` |
| architecture.json | `/shipkit-engineering-definition` (suggests, doesn't require) |
| engineering-definition.json | `/shipkit-engineering-definition` (suggests, doesn't require) |

### After This Skill

- User fixes blockers (natural capability — no skill needed)
- Re-run `/shipkit-preflight` to verify fixes
- Proceed with deployment

### Differs From

- `/shipkit-review-shipping` — Code quality on recent changes (pre-commit)
- `/shipkit-preflight` — MVP production readiness (pre-launch)
- `/shipkit-scale-ready` — Growth & enterprise readiness (post-traction)

### Progression

```
/shipkit-preflight  →  Launch MVP  →  Get traction  →  /shipkit-scale-ready
     (MVP)                                              (Growth/Enterprise)
```

## Thorough Mode (Deep Code Review)

The standard preflight is a **checklist-based audit** — fast, broad coverage.

For **maximum scrutiny**, use the `pr-review-toolkit` plugin to deep-review the entire codebase:

### Process

1. **Partition codebase into MECE chunks** using codebase-index concepts:
   ```
   Read .shipkit/codebase-index.json

   Example partitions:
   - auth (src/auth/**, src/middleware/auth*)
   - api (src/api/**)
   - database (src/db/**, src/models/**)
   - ui (src/components/**, src/pages/**)
   - config (src/config/**, *.config.*)
   ```

2. **Run pr-review-toolkit on each partition** with project context:
   ```
   For each partition:
   - Provide: partition files + codebase-index summary + architecture.json
   - Run: /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr
   - Collect: findings
   ```

3. **Aggregate findings** into preflight report by category

### When to Use

- Pre-launch of critical product
- After major refactor
- Security audit
- When standard preflight flags multiple concerns

### Trade-off

| Mode | Coverage | Depth | Cost |
|------|----------|-------|------|
| Standard | Entire project | Checklist scan | ~1 call |
| Thorough | Entire project | Deep per-partition | ~6 calls × N partitions |

### Installation

```bash
/plugin install pr-review-toolkit@claude-code-plugins
```

Then ask: "Run thorough preflight with deep code review"
