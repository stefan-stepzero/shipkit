# Jobs-to-be-Done Reference Guide

## What is Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)?

Jobs-to-be-Done is a framework for understanding customer motivation. Instead of asking "who is our customer?" we ask "what job are they trying to get done?"

**Core Insight:** People don't buy products—they "hire" products to get a job done.

## The JTBD Philosophy

### Jobs, Not Products

- A job is the progress a person seeks in a particular circumstance
- The job stays constant, but solutions evolve
- Example: The job "get a hole in the wall" existed before power drills

### Circumstances, Not Demographics

- Jobs arise in specific situations/contexts
- Same person has different jobs in different contexts
- Demographics don't predict behavior; circumstances do

### Outcomes, Not Features

- Customers hire products to achieve desired outcomes
- They measure success by how well the job gets done
- Features only matter if they help complete the job

## Three Types of Jobs

### 1. Functional Jobs
**What they're trying to accomplish physically/cognitively**

Examples:
- "Transport goods from warehouse to customer"
- "Analyze quarterly sales data"
- "Schedule team meetings"

Characteristics:
- Measurable, observable
- Can be broken into steps
- Usually the primary focus of traditional requirements gathering

### 2. Emotional Jobs
**How they want to feel during/after the job**

Examples:
- "Feel confident in my investment decision"
- "Avoid embarrassment from technical failures"
- "Feel like a good parent"

Characteristics:
- Internal, subjective
- Often unstated but critical
- Can override functional considerations

### 3. Social Jobs
**How they want to be perceived by others**

Examples:
- "Be seen as innovative by my team"
- "Demonstrate fiscal responsibility to the board"
- "Signal sophistication to friends"

Characteristics:
- Audience-dependent
- Reputation/status-driven
- Powerful in B2B and luxury B2C contexts

**Most jobs involve all three dimensions.** Understanding the emotional and social dimensions is often what differentiates winning solutions.

## The Job Statement Formula

> **When** [situation],
> **I want to** [motivation],
> **So I can** [desired outcome].

### Crafting Effective Job Statements

**Good job statements are:**
1. **Situational** - Tied to a specific context/trigger
2. **Solution-agnostic** - Don't assume a particular solution
3. **Outcome-focused** - Describe the end goal, not the means
4. **Stable** - Jobs don't change as quickly as solutions

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:** "I want a CRM system"
✅ **Good:** "When a potential customer reaches out, I want to track our conversation history, so I can provide consistent follow-up"

❌ **Bad:** "I want a faster computer"
✅ **Good:** "When I'm editing video for clients, I want to preview changes instantly, so I can iterate quickly and meet deadlines"

❌ **Bad:** "I need an app"
✅ **Good:** "When I'm at the grocery store, I want to remember what I'm out of at home, so I don't buy duplicates or forget essentials"

## Forces Diagram: Understanding Progress

The **Forces Diagram** explains why people switch (or don't switch) solutions.

```
        Forces FOR Change
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │                         │
    │  Push of the Situation  │ ──┐
    │  (current frustrations) │   │
    │                         │   │    PROGRESS
    └─────────────────────────┘   │   ──────────>
                                  │
    ┌─────────────────────────┐   │
    │                         │   │
    │  Pull of the New        │ ──┘
    │  (promise/attraction)   │
    │                         │
    └─────────────────────────┘

        Forces AGAINST Change
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │                         │
    │  Anxiety of the New     │ ──┐
    │  (fears, unknowns)      │   │
    │                         │   │    INERTIA
    └─────────────────────────┘   │   <──────────
                                  │
    ┌─────────────────────────┐   │
    │                         │   │
    │  Habit of the Present   │ ──┘
    │  (comfort, familiarity) │
    │                         │
    └─────────────────────────┘
```

**For someone to switch:**
- (Push + Pull) > (Anxiety + Habit)

### Designing for Each Force

**Increase Push:**
- Make current pain more visible
- Help them quantify cost of inaction
- Show what they're missing out on

**Increase Pull:**
- Demonstrate clear, compelling outcomes
- Show proof (case studies, demos, trials)
- Create desire for new capabilities

**Reduce Anxiety:**
- De-risk with trials, guarantees, reversibility
- Simplify onboarding and learning
- Provide social proof and testimonials

**Reduce Habit:**
- Make switching ridiculously easy
- Auto-import/migrate existing data
- Maintain familiar patterns where possible

## The Job Timeline

### 1. First Thought (Triggering Event)
**What makes them realize they have a job to do?**

- External: Deadline, requirement, change in environment
- Internal: Frustration threshold, new aspiration, realization
- Temporal: Seasonal, lifecycle event, project phase

**Research questions:**
- "Walk me through the moment you first thought about this..."
- "What was happening that made you realize you needed to do something?"

### 2. Passive Looking
**Low-effort exploration before committing to search**

- Casual conversations with colleagues
- Noticed ads or articles
- Recommendations from trusted sources
- "Keeping an eye out" without urgency

**Research questions:**
- "Before you actively started looking, how were you gathering information?"
- "Who did you talk to early on?"

### 3. Active Looking
**Dedicated search for solutions**

- Focused research (Google, review sites, analyst reports)
- Demos, trials, consultations
- Comparison shopping
- Building evaluation criteria

**Research questions:**
- "What search terms did you use?"
- "What were you looking for in a solution?"
- "What sources did you trust most?"

### 4. Deciding
**Narrowing down and committing**

- Final comparisons
- Building business case
- Getting approvals
- Negotiating terms

**Research questions:**
- "What finally made you choose this solution?"
- "What almost made you choose a different option?"
- "Who else needed to approve this decision?"

### 5. First Use / Onboarding
**Getting started with the new solution**

- Installation, setup, configuration
- Learning how to use it
- First successes (or frustrations)
- Integration with existing workflows

**Research questions:**
- "What were your first impressions?"
- "What was harder or easier than expected?"
- "When did you feel like you 'got it'?"

### 6. Ongoing Use
**Living with the solution**

- Routine usage patterns
- Discovering additional value
- Encountering limitations
- Adjusting workflows

**Research questions:**
- "How has your usage evolved over time?"
- "What surprised you about using this?"

### 7. Re-evaluation
**Considering whether to continue, expand, or switch**

- Measuring results
- Comparing to alternatives
- Renewal/expansion decisions
- Potential churn triggers

**Research questions:**
- "What would make you stop using this?"
- "What would make you expand usage?"

## B2C vs B2B Jobs: Key Differences

### B2C Jobs
**Characteristics:**
- Individual decision-maker (or small household)
- Lower price points
- Faster decision cycles
- Emotional/personal outcomes matter more
- Less formal evaluation process

**Example Job Landscape:**
```
Triggering Event: Kid spills juice on laptop
First Thought: "I need a new laptop, fast"
Timeline: 2-7 days from trigger to purchase
Evaluation: Read reviews, ask friends, visit store
Decision: Individual (maybe spouse consultation)
Success: "It works and I didn't overpay"
```

**B2C Research Focus:**
- Emotional jobs (feel smart, avoid regret)
- Social jobs (impress friends, signal identity)
- Convenience and ease (minimal effort to hire)

### B2B Jobs
**Characteristics:**
- Multiple stakeholders
- Higher price points
- Longer decision cycles
- ROI/business outcomes critical
- Formal evaluation, procurement, approval

**Example Job Landscape:**
```
Triggering Event: Board demands better forecasting
First Thought: "We need better analytics capabilities"
Timeline: 3-9 months from trigger to purchase
Evaluation: RFP, vendor demos, POCs, reference calls
Decision: Committee (finance, IT, end-users, executives)
Success: "Improved forecast accuracy + stakeholder buy-in"
```

**B2B Research Focus:**
- Functional jobs (measurable business outcomes)
- Social jobs (career risk, departmental politics)
- Implementation/change management (organizational resistance)
- Ongoing support and partnership (long-term relationship)

### Multi-Stakeholder Jobs (B2B)

In B2B, different people have different jobs:

**End User:**
- Job: "Complete daily tasks efficiently"
- Cares about: Ease of use, time savings

**Manager:**
- Job: "Ensure team productivity and compliance"
- Cares about: Adoption, oversight, reporting

**IT/Security:**
- Job: "Maintain secure, stable infrastructure"
- Cares about: Integrations, security, compliance

**Finance:**
- Job: "Optimize spending and demonstrate ROI"
- Cares about: Cost, business case, contract terms

**Executive Sponsor:**
- Job: "Drive strategic initiative success"
- Cares about: Business outcomes, competitive advantage

**You must map jobs for each stakeholder** and understand how they influence the buying decision.

## Research Methods for JTBD

### Switch Interviews (Most Powerful)
**Interview people who recently switched to or from a solution**

Why it works:
- Recent memory (details are fresh)
- They've already solved the problem (post-decision clarity)
- Real behavior, not hypothetical intent

Interview structure:
1. "Tell me about the first moment you thought about [solving this problem]..."
2. "Then what happened?"
3. (Keep asking "then what?" to map the timeline)
4. "What almost made you choose differently?"
5. "Looking back, what mattered most in your decision?"

### Job Safaris (Observational)
**Watch people doing the job in their natural environment**

What to observe:
- Workarounds they've created
- Tools they've cobbled together
- Emotional reactions during the job
- Interruptions and context switches
- Artifacts they create

Look for "compensating behaviors" - these reveal unmet needs.

### Job Stories from Support/Sales
**Mine existing conversations for job insights**

- Support tickets: What jobs are failing?
- Sales calls: What jobs triggered the search?
- Churn interviews: What job did we fail to help them complete?
- Expansion discussions: What new jobs are they trying to solve?

### Survey for Job Prioritization
**Once you've identified jobs, survey to prioritize**

Use Opportunity Scoring:
- Importance: "How important is [outcome]?" (1-5)
- Satisfaction: "How satisfied are you with current solutions?" (1-5)
- Opportunity Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)

High opportunity = Important but poorly satisfied outcomes

## Common JTBD Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing Jobs with Activities
❌ "I want to use a CRM"
✅ "I want to maintain relationships with prospects over time"

**Activities are solutions.** Jobs are progress sought.

### Mistake 2: Being Too Specific (Solutioning)
❌ "I want a mobile app with push notifications"
✅ "When I'm away from my desk, I want to stay informed about urgent issues"

**Specify the job, not the solution features.**

### Mistake 3: Being Too Vague
❌ "I want to be productive"
✅ "When I start my work day, I want to quickly identify the 3 most important tasks so I can prioritize effectively"

**Include the situation and desired outcome.**

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Emotional/Social Dimensions
"What's the functional job?" ← Only asking this misses half the story.

Also ask:
- "How do you want to feel when this is done?"
- "Who cares whether you do this well?"
- "What would be embarrassing or risky?"

### Mistake 5: Assuming One Job
Most products serve multiple jobs. Map them all:
- Primary job (main reason for hiring)
- Secondary jobs (nice-to-haves)
- Related jobs (upstream/downstream)

### Mistake 6: Focusing Only on Your Customers
**Also research:**
- People who chose competitors (why?)
- People who built DIY solutions (what can you learn?)
- People who do nothing (what's keeping them stuck?)

## JTBD and Product Strategy

### Job-First Product Development

**Traditional approach:**
1. Build features
2. Hope customers want them
3. Optimize conversion

**JTBD approach:**
1. Understand the job
2. Design for job success
3. Measure job completion

### Positioning Around Jobs

**Example: Airbnb**

Could position as:
- "Cheaper than hotels" (functional: save money)
- "Stay in unique spaces" (emotional: feel special)
- "Live like a local" (social: signal adventurousness)

They chose emotional/social jobs → different product, marketing, experience.

### Feature Prioritization

Ask: "Does this feature help users get the job done better/faster/cheaper?"

If no → Probably cut it (or it serves a different job you haven't mapped)

### Competitive Landscape

**Traditional view:** Competitors = similar products

**JTBD view:** Competition = anything hired to do the same job
- Direct competitors (same solution type)
- Indirect competitors (different solution type)
- DIY approaches
- Do nothing

**Example:** Uber competes with:
- Taxis (direct)
- Car ownership (indirect)
- Public transit (indirect)
- Asking a friend for a ride (DIY)
- Staying home (do nothing)

**Remember:** People don't want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole. Actually, they want to hang a picture. Actually, they want to feel like their house is a home.

**Keep asking "why" until you understand the real job.**
