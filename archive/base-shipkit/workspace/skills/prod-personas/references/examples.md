## Anti-Example: What NOT to Do

### ❌ Bad Persona: "Millennial Mark"

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-35
- Lives in urban area
- Uses social media
- Shops online

**Interests:**
- Coffee
- Technology
- Travel

**Problem:** This is demographics + stereotypes, not research-based

**Why it's bad:**
- No goals or pain points
- No behavior patterns
- No decision criteria
- No quotes from real people
- Can't make product decisions from this

### ✅ Good Version: "Mark - Remote-First Software Engineer"

**Based on:** 8 interviews with remote engineers

**Goals:**
- Maintain work-life boundaries
- Stay connected with distributed team
- Advance career without office facetime

**Pain Points:**
- Zoom fatigue from back-to-back meetings
- Async communication leads to delays
- Hard to build relationships remotely

**Current Tools:**
- Slack (feels like always-on)
- Zoom (draining)
- Notion (team wiki)
- GitHub (code collaboration)

**Quote from Interview:**
> "I love remote work, but I hate feeling like I need to be on Slack 24/7 to prove I'm working."

**Actionable:** Can design features specifically to solve async communication and boundary-setting.
