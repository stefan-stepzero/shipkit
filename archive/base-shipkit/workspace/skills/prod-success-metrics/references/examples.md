## Example 1: B2B SaaS - Team Collaboration Tool (MVP Stage)

### North Star Metric
**Weekly Active Teams Creating Value**
- Current: 350 teams
- Target: 1,000 teams (by end of Q2)
- Definition: Team with 3+ members who sent 10+ messages this week

**Why:** Teams that are active weekly have 85% annual retention vs 20% for inactive teams.

### Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)

| Metric | Definition | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|--------|
| New Signups | Team signups/week | 120 | 200 | 🟡 |
| Activation Rate | % teams sending 10+ messages in week 1 | 35% | 50% | 🔴 |
| Week 4 Retention | % of teams active in week 4 | 45% | 60% | 🟡 |
| DAU/MAU Ratio | Daily/Monthly active users | 22% | 30% | 🟡 |
| NPS | Net Promoter Score | 42 | 50+ | 🟡 |

### Acquisition Funnel

| Stage | Current | Target | Conversion |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| Website visitors | 10,000/mo | 15,000/mo | - |
| → Trial signups | 600/mo | 1,200/mo | 6% → 8% |
| → Activated teams | 210/mo | 600/mo | 35% → 50% ⚠️ |
| → Paying customers | 42/mo | 180/mo | 20% → 30% |

**Bottleneck:** Activation (only 35% of teams activate). Focus here first.

### Engagement Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Messages per active user per week | 45 | 60 |
| Files shared per team per week | 8 | 15 |
| Integrations enabled per team | 1.2 | 2.5 |
| Channels created per team | 3.5 | 6 |

### Revenue Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| MRR | $18,000 | $50,000 |
| ARPU | $85/team/month | $95 |
| CAC | $240 | <$200 |
| LTV | $2,040 (24 months avg) | $2,850 |
| LTV:CAC | 8.5:1 | >3:1 ✅ |
| Free → Paid Conversion | 20% | 30% |

**Decision:** LTV:CAC is healthy (8.5:1) → invest more in growth (increase ad spend).

### OKR for This Quarter

**Objective:** Improve activation to create habit-forming product

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Increase activation rate from 35% to 50%
- KR2: Increase week 4 retention from 45% to 60%
- KR3: Increase messages/user/week from 45 to 60

**Initiatives to hit KRs:**
- Onboarding checklist (guides teams to first value)
- Slack import tool (reduces friction to switch)
- Weekly engagement emails for inactive teams

## Example 2: B2C Mobile App - Fitness Tracker (MVP Stage)

### North Star Metric
**Weekly Active Users Completing Workouts**
- Current: 2,800 users
- Target: 10,000 users (by end of Q3)
- Definition: Users who complete 3+ workouts this week

**Why:** Users who work out 3+ times/week have 70% 6-month retention vs 10% for <3/week.

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| App Downloads | 1,500/week | 3,000/week | 🟡 |
| Day 1 Retention | 48% | 60% | 🔴 |
| Day 7 Retention | 22% | 35% | 🔴 |
| Day 30 Retention | 12% | 25% | 🔴 |
| DAU/MAU | 18% | 25% | 🟡 |
| Workouts/user/week (active users) | 3.2 | 4+ | 🟢 |

**Critical issue:** Retention is terrible. Only 12% of users still active after 30 days.

### Cohort Retention Analysis

| Cohort | Day 1 | Day 7 | Day 14 | Day 30 | Day 60 |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Jan 2024 | 45% | 18% | 10% | 8% | 6% |
| Feb 2024 | 50% | 24% | 14% | 12% | - |
| Mar 2024 | 52% | 26% | 16% | - | - |

**Good news:** Retention is improving with each cohort (recent product changes working).

### Engagement Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Sessions per user per week | 4.5 | 5+ |
| Workout completion rate | 78% | 85% |
| Streak: % users with 7+ day streak | 8% | 15% |
| Social: % users with accountability partner | 12% | 30% |

### Activation Funnel

| Stage | Current | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| App download | 100% | 100% |
| → Account created | 65% | 75% |
| → First workout completed | 40% | 60% ⚠️ |
| → 3 workouts in week 1 | 18% | 30% ⚠️ |

**Bottleneck:** Too many users download but never complete first workout (60% drop-off).

**Fix:** Simplify first workout (5 min instead of 10 min), reduce friction.

### Revenue Metrics (Freemium Model)

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Free users | 8,500 | 30,000 |
| Paid subscribers | 340 | 1,500 |
| Free → Paid conversion | 4% | 5% |
| MRR | $3,400 ($10/mo subscription) | $15,000 |
| Churn (monthly) | 8% | <5% |
| LTV | $150 (12.5 months avg) | $200 (20 months) |
| CAC (paid ads + influencers) | $35 | <$30 |
| LTV:CAC | 4.3:1 | >5:1 |

**Decision:** Churn is too high (8%/month). Fix retention before scaling acquisition.

### OKR for This Quarter

**Objective:** Build workout habit to drive retention

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Increase Day 30 retention from 12% to 25%
- KR2: Increase % users with 7+ day streak from 8% to 15%
- KR3: Increase % users with accountability partner from 12% to 30%

## Example 3: E-Commerce - Online Furniture Store (Established Stage)

### North Star Metric
**Monthly Revenue Per Visitor**
- Current: $4.80
- Target: $6.00 (by end of year)
- Definition: Total revenue / total visitors this month

**Why:** Combines traffic, conversion rate, and average order value into one metric.

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Monthly Revenue | $480,000 | $650,000 | 🟡 |
| Orders per Month | 1,200 | 1,600 | 🟡 |
| Average Order Value (AOV) | $400 | $450 | 🟡 |
| Conversion Rate | 1.2% | 1.6% | 🔴 |
| Cart Abandonment Rate | 72% | <65% | 🔴 |

### Acquisition Metrics

| Channel | Traffic | Conversion | CAC | Revenue/Visit |
|---------|---------|------------|-----|---------------|
| Organic Search | 45,000 | 1.8% | $0 | $7.20 |
| Paid Search | 20,000 | 1.5% | $18 | $6.00 |
| Social (organic) | 15,000 | 0.8% | $0 | $3.20 |
| Social (paid) | 10,000 | 1.0% | $25 | $4.00 |
| Email | 8,000 | 3.5% | $0 | $14.00 ✅ |
| Referral | 2,000 | 2.2% | $0 | $8.80 |

**Insight:** Email has highest conversion (3.5%) and revenue/visit ($14). Double down on email list building.

### Conversion Funnel

| Stage | Current | Conversion |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Visitors | 100,000/mo | - |
| → Product page views | 35,000 | 35% |
| → Add to cart | 4,200 | 12% of views, 4.2% of visitors |
| → Checkout initiated | 1,500 | 36% of carts ⚠️ (64% abandon) |
| → Purchase completed | 1,200 | 80% of checkouts |

**Biggest leak:** Cart abandonment (64% add to cart but don't check out).

**Fix ideas:**
- AR visualization (see furniture in your space)
- Free shipping threshold
- Cart abandonment emails

### Customer Lifetime Value

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Average # orders per customer | 1.8 | 2.5 |
| Repeat purchase rate (within 12 months) | 35% | 45% |
| Customer LTV | $720 | $1,125 |
| CAC (blended) | $45 | <$40 |
| LTV:CAC | 16:1 | >10:1 ✅ |

### Product Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Return rate (due to "doesn't fit") | 8% | <5% ⚠️ |
| Customer service contacts per order | 0.15 | <0.10 |
| Time from order to delivery | 7 days | <5 days |
| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | 58 | 65+ |

**Issue:** 8% return rate due to size/fit issues. AR feature should reduce this.

### Revenue Breakdown

| Category | Revenue | % of Total | AOV |
|----------|---------|------------|-----|
| Living Room | $240,000 | 50% | $450 |
| Bedroom | $144,000 | 30% | $380 |
| Office | $72,000 | 15% | $350 |
| Accessories | $24,000 | 5% | $80 |

**Opportunity:** Accessories have low AOV but could be add-ons to larger purchases.

### OKR for This Quarter

**Objective:** Reduce friction in purchase funnel

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Reduce cart abandonment from 72% to 65%
- KR2: Increase conversion rate from 1.2% to 1.6%
- KR3: Reduce return rate from 8% to 5%

## Example 4: Developer Tool - API Monitoring SaaS (MVP Stage)

### North Star Metric
**APIs Monitored by Paying Customers**
- Current: 420 APIs
- Target: 1,500 APIs (by Q3)
- Definition: Unique API endpoints under active paid monitoring

**Why:** More APIs monitored = more value delivered = higher retention and expansion.

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Free Signups | 180/mo | 300/mo | 🟡 |
| Free → Paid Conversion | 12% | 20% | 🔴 |
| MRR | $8,400 | $25,000 | 🟡 |
| Logo Churn (monthly) | 4% | <3% | 🔴 |
| Net Dollar Retention | 95% | >100% | 🔴 |

### Activation & Engagement

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Time to First Alert | 8 minutes | <5 min |
| % users who add 2nd API within week 1 | 45% | 60% |
| % users who integrate Slack/PagerDuty | 35% | 55% |
| Alerts sent per user per week | 3.2 | 4+ |
| False positive rate | 12% | <8% ⚠️ |

**Issue:** False positive rate too high (12%). Users snooze/ignore alerts → churn.

### Pricing Tiers & Expansion

| Tier | # Customers | ARPU | Churn |
|------|-------------|------|-------|
| Free | 1,200 | $0 | 15%/mo |
| Starter ($49/mo, 5 APIs) | 42 | $49 | 6%/mo |
| Pro ($149/mo, 20 APIs) | 28 | $149 | 3%/mo |
| Enterprise ($499/mo, unlimited) | 8 | $650 (avg $499-$999) | 0%/mo |

**Insight:** Higher tiers have much lower churn. Focus on upselling Starter → Pro.

### Expansion Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| % customers who upgrade tier within 3 months | 18% | 30% |
| % customers who add team members | 22% | 40% |
| Expansion MRR (from upsells) | $840/mo | $2,500/mo |
| Contraction MRR (from downgrades) | $420/mo | <$500/mo |
| Net Expansion Rate | +5% | +15% |

**Calculate Net Dollar Retention:**
```
NDR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Churn - Contraction) / Starting MRR
NDR = ($8,000 + $840 - $320 - $420) / $8,000 = 102.5%
```

Target: >110% (expansion exceeds churn significantly).

### Product Usage Patterns

**Power users** (high retention, likely to expand):
- Monitor 10+ APIs
- Integrate with Slack or PagerDuty
- Custom alert thresholds set
- Check dashboard 3+ times/week

**At-risk users** (likely to churn):
- Monitor 1-2 APIs only
- No integrations
- Don't check dashboard (rely on emails only)
- High false positive rate (>15%)

**Action:** Identify at-risk users, reach out proactively to help them configure properly.

### OKR for This Quarter

**Objective:** Improve free-to-paid conversion and reduce churn

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Increase free → paid conversion from 12% to 20%
- KR2: Reduce logo churn from 4% to <3%
- KR3: Achieve Net Dollar Retention >110% (through expansion)

## Example 5: Marketplace - Freelance Platform (Established Stage)

### North Star Metric
**Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) Per Month**
- Current: $1.2M
- Target: $2M (by end of year)
- Definition: Total value of transactions on platform

**Why:** GMV drives revenue (we take 15% commission), and indicates marketplace health.

### Two-Sided Marketplace Metrics

**Supply Side (Freelancers):**

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Active freelancers | 2,400 | 4,000 |
| New freelancer signups/mo | 320 | 500 |
| Freelancer activation rate | 45% (get first gig) | 60% |
| Avg earnings per active freelancer/mo | $850 | $1,000 |
| Freelancer retention (6 months) | 65% | 75% |

**Demand Side (Clients):**

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Active clients | 580 | 1,000 |
| New client signups/mo | 95 | 150 |
| Client activation rate | 70% (post first job) | 80% |
| Avg spend per client/mo | $2,200 | $2,500 |
| Client retention (6 months) | 72% | 80% |

### Marketplace Balance

**Liquidity Metric:**
```
Liquidity = (Jobs filled within 48 hours) / (Total jobs posted)
Current: 78%
Target: >85%
```

**Supply/Demand Ratio:**
```
Ratio = Active freelancers / Active clients
Current: 4.1:1 (healthy range: 3:1 to 6:1)
```

**If ratio too high:** Too many freelancers, not enough work → freelancers churn
**If ratio too low:** Not enough freelancers, jobs go unfilled → clients churn

### Transaction Funnel

| Stage | Current | Conversion |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Client posts job | 1,200/mo | - |
| → Proposals received | 1,100 | 92% |
| → Client reviews proposals | 980 | 89% |
| → Freelancer hired | 850 | 87% |
| → Project completed | 780 | 92% |
| → Client pays | 760 | 97% |
| → Client posts another job | 420 | 55% |

**Opportunity:** 55% of clients post another job. Increase this to 70% through post-project follow-up.

### Revenue Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| GMV | $1.2M/mo | $2M/mo |
| Take Rate | 15% | 15% (don't change) |
| Revenue | $180k/mo | $300k/mo |
| Revenue per client | $310/mo | $450/mo |
| Revenue per freelancer | $127/mo | $150/mo |

### Trust & Safety Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Dispute rate | 3.2% | <2% |
| Fraud/scam reports | 0.8% | <0.5% |
| Avg project rating (1-5) | 4.6 | >4.7 |
| % projects with review | 82% | >90% |

### OKR for This Quarter

**Objective:** Grow GMV while maintaining marketplace quality

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Increase GMV from $1.2M to $1.6M/mo
- KR2: Improve liquidity (jobs filled in 48h) from 78% to 85%
- KR3: Increase client repeat rate from 55% to 70%

## Stage-Specific Metric Priorities

### POC Stage
**Focus:** Validation

**Primary metrics:**
1. Problem validation: % of interviews confirming pain
2. Solution validation: % of users completing core workflow
3. Willingness to pay: % who'd pay $X

**Don't track:**
- Revenue (too early)
- Churn (sample size too small)
- Scalability (premature)

### MVP Stage
**Focus:** Product-market fit

**Primary metrics:**
1. North Star metric (value delivered)
2. Retention (Day 7, Day 30, cohort curves)
3. Engagement (DAU/MAU, core action frequency)
4. NPS (user satisfaction)
5. Activation rate (time to value)

**Secondary:**
- CAC (but don't over-optimize yet)
- Early revenue (validate pricing)

**Decision point:** If retention <40% at Day 30 or NPS <30, you don't have PMF yet.

### Established Stage
**Focus:** Sustainable growth

**Track everything:**
1. Growth (MRR, GMV, user growth)
2. Unit economics (LTV, CAC, LTV:CAC, payback)
3. Retention (cohorts, churn, NDR)
4. Engagement (DAU/MAU, feature adoption)
5. Revenue efficiency (CAC payback, gross margin)
6. Market position (market share, NPS vs competitors)

**Optimize for:**
- Profitability
- Predictable growth
- Competitive moat
