## Product-Specific Metrics

**[Customize based on your product type]**

| Metric | Definition | Current | Target |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|

| [Core action 2] | [e.g., projects created/month] | [value] | [goal] |
| [Value indicator] | [e.g., avg time saved per user] | [value] | [goal] |

**Examples by product type:**
- **Collaboration tool:** Messages sent, files shared, invites sent
- **E-commerce:** Orders/month, cart abandonment rate, avg order value
- **SaaS:** Feature adoption rate, seats per account, API calls
- **Mobile app:** Sessions/user/week, session duration, screens per session

## Leading vs Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators** (predict future success):
- [ ] [Metric that drives outcomes - e.g., feature adoption, NPS, engagement depth]
- [ ] [Metric 2]
- [ ] [Metric 3]

**Lagging Indicators** (measure past results):
- [ ] [Outcome metric - e.g., revenue, churn, market share]
- [ ] [Metric 2]
- [ ] [Metric 3]

**Why this matters:** Leading indicators let you course-correct early. Lagging indicators confirm success/failure but are harder to influence directly.

## Success Criteria by Stage

### POC Stage
**Goal:** Validate that the problem is real and solution resonates

- [ ] **Problem validation:** [X] users confirm pain point in interviews
- [ ] **Solution validation:** [X%] of beta users complete core workflow
- [ ] **Willingness to pay:** [X%] of users say they'd pay $[Y] for this

**Decision point:** If validation fails, pivot or stop. If succeeds, move to MVP.

### MVP Stage
**Goal:** Achieve early product-market fit signals

- [ ] **Retention:** [X%] of users active after 30 days
- [ ] **Engagement:** Users complete core action [X] times/week
- [ ] **NPS:** Net Promoter Score ≥[40]
- [ ] **Organic growth:** [X%] of new users from referrals

**Decision point:** If metrics hit targets, invest in growth. If not, iterate on product.

### Established Stage
**Goal:** Sustainable, profitable growth

- [ ] **Growth rate:** [X%] MoM growth (or [Y%] YoY)
- [ ] **Unit economics:** LTV:CAC ratio ≥3:1
- [ ] **Profitability:** Contribution margin ≥[70%]
- [ ] **Market share:** [X%] of addressable market

**Decision point:** Optimize, scale, or enter new markets.
