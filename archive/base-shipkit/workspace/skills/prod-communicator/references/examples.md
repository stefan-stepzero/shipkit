# CloudDocs - Investor One-Pager

**Date:** March 2024
**Contact:** Jane Smith, CEO | jane@clouddocs.com

## The Problem (In One Sentence)

Marketing teams waste 15+ hours/week managing content across disconnected tools (Google Docs, Notion, Slack, email), leading to version chaos and missed deadlines.

**Market Size:**

- SOM (3-year target): $45M

## The Solution (In One Sentence)

CloudDocs is the single source of truth for marketing content—from brief to approval to publication—with real-time collaboration, automated workflows, and integrated asset management.

**Key Differentiator:**
Purpose-built for marketers (not generic docs), with content-specific features like brand compliance checks, approval workflows, and CMS integrations.

## Example 2: Team Update (Feature Kick-Off)

# Team Update: Smart Notifications

**Date:** March 15, 2024
**From:** Product Team
**To:** Engineering, Design, QA

---

## TL;DR

**What we're building:** Intelligent notifications that surface what's urgent, not just what's new
**Why it matters:** #1 feature request from customers—"I miss important updates in the noise"
**When it ships:** Beta April 15, GA May 1
**What you need to do:** Read this doc, attend design review 3/18, commit to sprint by 3/20

---

## The Big Picture

### Why We're Doing This

**Customer Problem:**
We've learned that Marketing Managers (our primary persona) struggle with notification overload. Specifically:
- Receive 50-100 notifications/day, miss the 3-5 that matter
- Check app compulsively to avoid missing something
- Feel anxious about being "out of the loop"

**Impact if we succeed:**
- For customers: Reduce time checking app by 70%, increase confidence they're not missing key updates
- For the business: Improve daily active usage (better engagement = lower churn)
- For the team: Differentiation vs competitors (they have dumb notifications, we have smart ones)

**Strategic alignment:**
Aligns with Q1 goal of "Best-in-class user experience" and Product Constitution principle: "Respect user attention"

## Example 3: Customer Announcement (Product Launch)

# Introducing Priority Inbox: Never Miss What Matters

**Your most important updates, front and center—automatically.**

---

## What's New

We've launched Priority Inbox: an intelligent feed that learns what's urgent for you and surfaces it at the top. No more scrolling through hundreds of notifications to find the ones that matter.

---

## Why We Built This

We heard you. Over 300 of you told us:

> "I get so many notifications that I miss the important ones—like when my CEO comments on my doc or a client deadline is approaching."

We dug deep into how teams use CloudDocs and discovered that the average user receives 73 notifications per day, but only 4-6 are truly time-sensitive. The rest? Noise.

---

## How It Works

### Smart Prioritization

**What it does:**
Priority Inbox automatically identifies your most important notifications based on who sent them, what they're about, and how time-sensitive they are.

**Why it matters:**
See critical updates first—always. CEO feedback, client deadlines, and approval requests rise to the top.

**How to use it:**
1. Open CloudDocs (Priority Inbox is your new default view)
2. See your top 5-10 priority items highlighted in gold
3. Review or dismiss—Priority Inbox learns from your actions

## Example 4: Executive Summary (Strategic Initiative)

# Executive Summary: Enterprise Expansion Strategy

**Date:** March 2024
**Prepared by:** Jane Smith, CEO
**Distribution:** Executive team

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Seek executive alignment on entering the enterprise market (1000+ employees) in Q3 2024

**TL;DR:**
Our SMB product has strong PMF (125% NRR, 68 NPS). Enterprise deals are coming inbound but we're not set up to close or serve them. I recommend building enterprise capabilities now to capture $10M+ ARR opportunity by 2025.

**Recommendation:**
Invest $800K to build enterprise features and sales motion in H2 2024, targeting $2M enterprise ARR by end of 2025.

---

## Strategic Context

### Why This Matters

**Business Opportunity:**
- 45 inbound enterprise requests in last 6 months (avg deal size: $150K vs $18K SMB)
- TAM expansion: +$35B (enterprise content management market)
- Revenue potential: $10M enterprise ARR achievable by 2026 (conservative)

**Competitive Position:**
- Current: #1 in SMB, non-player in enterprise
- Opportunity: Competitors focus on enterprise OR SMB, not both—we can own the full spectrum
- Risk of inaction: Competitors launch SMB products, squeeze us from both sides

### Alignment with Company Goals

| Company Goal | How This Initiative Contributes |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| $10M ARR by EOY 2025 | Enterprise adds $2M ARR (20% of goal) |
| Gross margin >80% | Enterprise seats fill existing capacity (pure margin expansion) |
| Market leadership | Own both SMB and enterprise = broader positioning |
