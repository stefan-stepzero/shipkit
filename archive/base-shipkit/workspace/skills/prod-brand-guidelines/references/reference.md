# Brand Guidelines - Reference

## What Are Brand Guidelines?

Brand guidelines define the **personality, voice, and visual identity** of your product. They ensure consistency across all touchpoints and help your product stand out from competitors.

## Why This Matters

**Consistency builds trust:**
- Users recognize your product instantly
- Every interaction reinforces your values
- Your team knows how to make brand decisions

**Differentiation wins markets:**
- Clear personality attracts your target users
- Distinct visual style is memorable
- Authentic voice creates emotional connection

## Key Components

### 1. Brand Personality

**Core Values:** What you believe in
- Guide decision-making
- Attract like-minded users
- Differentiate from competitors

**Personality Traits:** How you behave
- Choose 3-5 specific traits
- Make them actionable (not just aspirational)
- Show concrete examples

**Brand Archetypes:** Character frameworks
- The Hero: Courageous, inspires achievement
- The Creator: Innovative, values self-expression
- The Caregiver: Nurturing, protects and supports
- The Explorer: Free-spirited, seeks new experiences

### 2. Voice & Tone

**Voice = Personality** (consistent)

- Serious vs. Playful

**Tone = Mood** (context-dependent)
- Onboarding: Encouraging
- Errors: Apologetic, helpful
- Success: Celebratory
- Marketing: Aspirational

### 3. Visual Direction

**Color Psychology:**
- Blue: Trust, stability (banks, healthcare)
- Red: Energy, urgency (food, entertainment)
- Green: Growth, health (sustainability, wellness)
- Purple: Luxury, creativity (premium products)

**Typography Personality:**
- Serif: Traditional, trustworthy
- Sans-serif: Modern, clean

- Script: Elegant, personal

**Visual Style Spectrum:**
```
Minimal ←→ Maximal
Serious ←→ Playful

```

## Best Practices

### Start With Why
Don't design brand for aesthetics alone:
1. Define target user (refer to personas)
2. Identify their emotional needs
3. Choose brand elements that resonate

### Be Specific, Not Generic
Bad: "We're innovative and user-focused"
Good: "We're the engineer who explains things clearly, not the expert who talks over your head"

### Create Constraints
- Pick 3-5 colors (not 20)
- Choose 1-2 fonts (not 6)
- Define 3-5 personality traits (not 15)

### Test With Real Content
Apply guidelines to actual UI:
- Login screen
- Error message
- Empty state
- Marketing headline

Does it feel right? Adjust accordingly.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Corporate
Generic values like "innovation, quality, customer focus" mean nothing.

**Fix:** Be specific about HOW you embody these values.

### 2. Mismatched Personality
Voice says "friendly and approachable" but visuals are cold and corporate.

**Fix:** Ensure voice, tone, and visuals all support the same personality.

### 3. No Differentiation
Brand could describe any competitor.

**Fix:** Explicitly call out what competitors do vs. what you do differently.

### 4. Aspirational, Not Authentic
Brand is what you WISH you were, not what you ACTUALLY are.

**Fix:** Be honest. Users see through fake personas.

## Examples by Stage

### POC/MVP
**Keep it simple:**
- 2-3 core values
- Clear voice (professional, casual, or playful)
- Basic color palette (primary, accent, functional)
- One font family

### Established Product
**More sophisticated:**
- Full brand archetype
- Detailed tone variations by context
- Complete visual system
- Comprehensive usage guidelines

## Integration With Other Skills

**Reference these when defining brand:**
- **Strategic Thinking:** What's our positioning?
- **Personas:** Who are we designing for?
- **Market Analysis:** How do competitors brand themselves?

**Use these guidelines when creating:**
- **Interaction Design:** Visual style informs UI patterns
- **User Stories:** Voice and tone guide copy
- **Communications:** Brand personality shapes messaging
